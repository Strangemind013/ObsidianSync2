## Steps

1. Read the scene cold, “listening” for error signals.
    
2. Identify problems based on checklist (below).
    

1. Do not identify more than 3 problems.
    
2. Start with most egregious and go to least egregious.
    

1. For instance, do not address infodumping or valenced language if there are no Objects of Desire (OOD) or Five Commandments of Storytelling.
    
2. Our job is to identify and report error signals, then offer ideas around fixing them, but it is the writer’s job to decide on the fixes.
    

4. Annotate the document with the OOD, 5Cs, and any problems identified.
    
5. Identify “next steps” homework and add to the bottom of the scene.
    
6. Record a video outlining what they did right, what they did wrong, and what you want them to do for homework the following week.
    

## Checklist

1. Conscious Object of Desire
    

1. Can you identify a clear, concrete, [S.M.A.R.T. conscious object of desire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C14PtJeL8EM) for the protagonist (and other characters)?
    
2. For each character word the OOD as: [[CHARACTER] wants [X] without having to [Y]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M15bb6DQiPA).
    

3. Five Commandments of Storytelling.
    

1. Can you clearly identify each of the [Five Commandments of Storytelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcSZelo6v5k) in the scene?
    
2. If so, do they work? Do they build out of the OOD? Is the Crisis a clear win/lose decision with stakes?
    
3. Is there a clear Value Shift by the end of the scene?
    

  

At this point the scene “works” because something meaningful changes.

So there IS a signal. Now we identify any noise in that signal by addressing the rest of the rubic.

  
  
  
  

3. Progressive Complications and Turning Point
    

1. Does the protagonist continue changing tactics as their OOD is denied by the force(s) of antagonism?
    
2. Are there [escalating Progressive Complications that end in an irreversable Turning Point](https://youtu.be/vg1pIJRkRD8)?
    

5. Protagonist and Force(s) of Antagonism Correctly Balanced
    

1. Is the protagonist too competent? Do they actually reach a Turning Point and Crisis?
    
2. Are the forces of antagonism appropriately strong / matched with the protagonist?
    

7. Showing Writing
    

1. Is the writer relying on Telling language to write the story? i.e. Are they [telling instead of showing](https://youtu.be/XpFbekAF1oQ)?
    

9. Consistent Genre
    

1. Does the [Value at Stake](https://youtu.be/QbgccESuNdY) change between the Inciting Incident and Resolution?
    

11. Protagonist as Outputter
    

1. Did the writer put the [protagonist](https://youtu.be/NBbomaMEPOc) in the Inputter role instead of the Outputter role?
    

13. Infodumping
    

1. Does the writer deliver [too much information](https://youtu.be/vCOjo4h2d9A) to the reader at once and/or before the reader needs to know it?
    
2. Does the writer deliver irrelevant, unnecessary information to the reader?
    

15. Scene Starts Too Early
    

1. Does the Inciting Incident come too late in the scene?
    

17. Bad Dialogue
    

1. Is the [dialogue](https://youtu.be/iqjcbQGxSj0) speaking to the reader instead of the other characters (embedding exposition in the dialogue)?
    
2. Is the character pursuing their OOD in each line of dialogue?
    

19. Inconsistent Action
    

1. Do things happen in a linear way or is it hopping back and forth in time causing confusion for the reader?
    
2. Are objects or people moving in unlikely or confusing ways?
    

21. Valenced Language
    

1. Are there [good nouns and verbs](https://youtu.be/WndeVTnoVhI) that match the theme of the scene?
    
2. Are [adjectives and adverbs](https://youtu.be/OZXrGTkfGp0) incorrectly making up for bad nouns and verbs?
    
3. Is the author’s opinion on what is going on coming through in the word choice without it having to be directly on the page?
    

23. Well Developed Setting and Characters
    

1. Are the correct details for the setting and characters given to the point where the reader can follow the story without over-developing them and leading to infodumping?
