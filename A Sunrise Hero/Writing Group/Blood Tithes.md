Chapter 1: 

- awesome atmosphere
- great introduction and worldbuilding
- Andre Carovina is cool
- Action is smooth and easily understood
- Ending line is *chef's kiss*
- Satisfied but also intrigued
- promise of action, blood, and intrigue
- noir
- nailed it so hard you could call it Jesus


Chapter 2:

- Funny how both our chapter 2's were so similar. Just guys dealing with their cunt bosses
- The plot thickens
- A bit of info dumping at the start, though it kinda works, since the reader wanted to know about it from the previous chapter. Also, he's in traffic, so it's organic that he thinks about these things
- The scene change was a bit jarring
- I think you could maintain interest by having the character pull up to the Ovshka first before all the info dumping.
- We didn't need all this worldbuilding right now, and could be sprinkled in organically
- New characters felt awkwardly introduced
- Dialog could use some more character and subtext. They're all too blunt right now
- A lot of telling
- Not a fan of all the exclamation points in the dialog
- There's an intangible that's missing
