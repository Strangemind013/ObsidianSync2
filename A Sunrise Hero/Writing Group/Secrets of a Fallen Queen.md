Prologue 
- Short and interesting enough 
- A bit vague without names
- A good hook
- Could use some setting
- A bit exposition-ey at the end

Chapter 1

- lots of mysteries hinted at
- Descriptions could use some tightening up
- Scene setting during new places
- Lack of real tension, lots of jump scares
- Cliffhanger ending is earned, but didn't work for me

Chapter 2:
- Lots of intrigue and questions introduced
- Be careful of this, as sometimes reader might lose interest before the question is answered
- I think their back and forth regarding the contents of the book overstayed its welcome a bit
-
