Chapter 1:

- Lots of tropes, lots of telling
- You're making the common mistakes of a beginner writer, but in a good way. I mean it's good to make these mistakes, be aware of it, and then never do it again. 
- rebels are cunts this time, yay!
- I like the twist at the end
- You have an interesting story to tell, and it feels all fairy-tale like with all the usual stereotypes. Just need a bit more polish with your prose and technique but that's something everyone is going through.
