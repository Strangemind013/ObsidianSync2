Chapter 1:


- Really hammers in the helplessness and fear of the test subjects
- Does a good job of making you hate the lab workers
- Some real world contrast

- Feels like a first draft
- Could do with better descriptions
- Needs editing
- Some things aren't clear
- This feels like a prologue, and the main bit is with Motscha.
- Confusion on what the story is really about


Chapter 2:

- Intrigued by what all this is about
- I feel like a prisoner and warden wouldn't chat like they do
- You don't have to describe minutiae (walks a little faster, the way a leg moves up and down) sometimes telling is ok
- Stalloi and Mier... what are they?
- Characters aren't consistent in how they act regarding the tests being done to them, Sometimes casual, sometimes despair
- some head-hopping
- scene could use a stronger purpose
