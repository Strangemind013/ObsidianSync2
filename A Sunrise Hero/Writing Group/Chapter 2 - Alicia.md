Okay, I'm gonna be blunt. I saw a significant decrease in quality when compared to your 'Joel' chapter. I've tried my best on multiple occasions to finish the text, but I struggle to read even the first few pages. I'm not saying this to be mean, but there is a general lack of cohesiveness to the storytelling. I found a randomness in the way you string thoughts and sentences together.  There were multiple times where I'm confused if what's happening is a flashback or in the present. You jump from introspection to flashback to backstory and it's giving me whiplash. 

Instead of focusing solely on the negatives, I'm just gonna leave some things that I keep in the back of my head when writing. I don't consider myself an expert by any means, so do take this with a grain of salt. 

First is to be intentional in the words you leave on the page. You're not just putting down words to meet a word count. I visualize myself as a guide to the reader's reading experience. So long as they read my writing, I am the 'director' of their thoughts. I dictate what they think about. Isn't that a wonderful thing? 

On a related note: as a writer, I am constantly fighting tooth and nail for my reader's attention. That's my main goal. That's why every word must serve a purpose. Multiple, in fact. The first of which is to be interesting. Take this passage from your chapter, for example:

*Alicia was done being frightened by it all. It had almost taken her five long years to realise it. The real danger was here. To be shackled to a place where her fate would end up spending a life buried in books, without family or loved ones.*

To me, the text seems detached from the character. Flat and sterile. How do I convey this to the reader the most interesting way that I can? How do I make this more in line to how the character would actually think about these things? Now I don't know much about Alicia right now, but let's say she's on the younger side, dejected and isolated. Here's me taking a quick stab on how I would try to write it:

*She tightened her clenched fist, a way to stop the shaking. So that's what it was. She'd been scared out of her wits this whole time. Five crappy years of being locked up with nothing but dusty tomes for company. Might not sound so bad at first, but this wasn't how she wanted her life to turn out. But right now there's not much she could do. No way to escape. Was she destined to do this forever? Maybe that's where the fear was coming from.*

I know that this isn't what you're trying to write. I just wanted to illustrate that there are subtler, more creative ways to convey the information you want. I'm gonna dig in to my thought process here for a sec:

I first made a mental note of what I wanted to convey based on your text.
- She's scared, but she wants to overcome said fear
- It took her five years to build up the courage (I changed this since it seems off to 'realize' that you're done being scared)
- She's been stuck in a place that has something to do with books


I opened with her physical, bodily reaction to being afraid. I can't just say *Alicia was done being frightened by it all.* That wouldn't be very interesting now, would it? Besides, that's just telling. Show don't tell, and all that. Instead I use her action to relay that she was done being scared. She tightened her fist to stop the shaking. She's actively suppressing her body's response to fear. She was done being frightened.

The next point would be to convey the point that it took her five years to be done with fear. But how do I relate it to the first sentence in a smooth manner? I take my time with it. *So that's what it was. She'd been scared out of her wits this whole time.* I show that realization as it happens real time, having her fear represented by the shaking. I intentionally ended the sentence with *this whole time* as a way to have the reader asking questions. This whole time? How long was that? Which I then answer in the following sentence. Setups and payoffs. It works on every level.

In a way to be efficient, I then combine the information of how long with the conditions of her situation. *Five crappy years of being locked up with nothing but dusty tomes for company.* Note my word choice of 'crappy' as a way to characterize her as a younger person. 

With that, I successfully relayed the three bullet points of information that I set out to convey. I should be done, right? The paragraph should've ended? Well, not exactly. I end the paragraph with her thoughts, as a way to stay in character. She wouldn't just think about her situation matter-of-factly, she'd try to reason it out. Maybe even justify it, as anyone would've done. *Might not sound so bad at first, but this wasn't how she wanted her life to turn out. But right now there's not much she could do. No way to escape. Was she destined to do this forever?* It doubles down on her feeling of helplessness, yet also shows her reasoning things out. She's asking questions, which in turn, gets the reader asking questions. Them asking questions gets them turning the page.

 *Maybe that's where the fear was coming from.* Lastly, I end the paragraph in a neat little bow by circling back to the beginning--to her fear. It's a payoff to the intrigue we've built by showing her fear. An answered question. She's afraid because she might be stuck there forever. What is she gonna do about it? Will she succeed? Read on and find out!
 
 Okay so I'm going to end things here since I've rambled on a bit, and I've spent enough time on this that I could. I hope it doesn't come off as preachy and being a know-it-all. Please always keep in mind that I have good intentions, even if it might not seem that way sometimes. I really just want to help. So that's that. Cheers!
