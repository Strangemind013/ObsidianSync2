Caide chuckled, eyes stinging, as the ashes of his failure fell around him. Did he really think it would be that easy? Did he honestly believe that they could just show up, buckets in hand, and put a stop to the–

“This funny to you?” Batch spat. Drenched in sweat and covered in soot, he glared up at Caide like a hateful specter. “We haven’t saved a single house, and you’re *laughing?*”

Caide gritted his teeth for what felt like the hundredth time. Damned Batch. He’d be left with nothing but gums at this point. He let out a breath and resisted the urge to wallop the mouthy bastard with one of the lengths of charred wood strewn about. No one would argue that he didn’t deserve it. Instead, he shot Batch a warning look, let it linger a bit, and looked away.

Half of Spinner’s Row, a ramshackle street of tottering houses, already churned with smoke and flame when they arrived. The poor, exhausted carthorses made excellent time considering the load they had to bear. On one cart sat the boys from Sadampo, while the other hauled barrelsful of water. It wasn’t enough. Not nearly enough. The fire raged unimpeded despite their best efforts. By the time the barrels ran dry, eight families mourned the long pile of rubble that was once their row of houses.

“On the bright side,” Pao said, gathering scattered buckets and placing it on the cart. “At least everyone made it out.”

“That had nothing to do with us,” Sweet-tooth said, running a wet rag over his soot-stained arms. “They would’ve made it out anyway.”

Lon shambled over to the cart and slammed his bucket on the deck. “Then what the fuck are we doing here?”

A good question, to be sure. One Caide had been asking himself before Batch so rudely interrupted, as he always did. A fact was made clear, however–their approach wasn’t working. Not at its current state. 

“We’re trying,“ said Caide. “Because someone has to start.”

“No, *we’re* trying.” Batch sneered. “You just stand there like you’re too good for this. Maybe you should start–”

“Enough.” Duck laid a hand on Batch’s shoulder, which was promptly shrugged off. “This bickering’s not helping, is it?” He gave Caide a look, and it didn’t take much to infer its meaning. Everyone knew.

*Something has to change.*

A crowd had gathered around them, whispering and muttering to themselves. Nothing brought people together like attending someone else’s misfortune. A few faces in the crowd frowned at them with bitter incredulity. Like their attempts at stopping the fires were an affront to their faith. Did they honestly believe that the Summer God wanted this? That, or maybe the crowd simply resented them for failing.

Caide looked around at his boys, the shadow of defeat looming over every one of them. “We should head back,” he said. “We’ve worn out our welcome here.” 

Duck quietly did a head count, muttering to himself. “Anyone seen Crow?”

Pung replaced the lids on each of the water barrels, secured them to the deck with thick ropes, and shut the gate on the cart bed. “Check the other cart. He could be taking a nap.”

“Here,” said Pao. 

“Leave him be–let him take all the sleep he can get.” Duck shuffled over to Caide with an I-have-to-tell-you-something look on his face. “We’re running low on salve, boss. Pung and Pao got hit with small burns, maybe Lon too. I should have enough back at the Fool’s Mug, but after that we’re out.” 

“I’ll get some on the way back,” Caide said. Thank the heavens for Duck. He’d taken the initiative with keeping the unruly of their group–mostly Batch– in line. Moreover, he’d been acting as a go-between for Caide and the rest of the boys, relaying their needs and all that. Knew how to treat wounds, too. Surely, he wasn’t doing this solely by the kindness of his heart. There had to be a catch here. “Alright, Pung,” Caide said. “Get everyone back to the Fool’s Mug. And I mean *straight back*–no wandering off.” He looked pointedly at Sweet-tooth, who grinned sheepishly. He had a habit of getting lost and being found drunk, much to everyone’s annoyance. 

Pung nodded and herded the boys back to the cart. Another blessing, this one. The rest of the boys had a healthy respect–or fear–of the big man from their time back in Sadampo, and Caide had been depending on him to keep things running smoothly. With everyone else on board, Pung tugged at the reins and the cart trotted away. 

Duck hopped on the other cart–the one with all the empty barrels. He gripped the reins, took a breath, and leaned over. “Say, boss…”

*And there it is. The catch.*

“Hmm?”

“My daughter down at Fishwife Lane… She’s with child, you see, and due any day now. I’m not asking to see her, of course–but could you maybe…”

“Could I maybe what?”

“Any chance you could see how she’s doing? It would mean the world–”

“Fine,” said Caide. “I’ll see what I can do.”

“Thank you, boss. I really–”

Caide slapped one of the horses on the rump, and the cart to lurched forward with a neighing start. Duck squawked and fumbled at the reins, pulled hard, and righted the cart’s advance with a string of curses. Soon enough he disappeared into the distance and made his way towards the Fool’s Mug.
