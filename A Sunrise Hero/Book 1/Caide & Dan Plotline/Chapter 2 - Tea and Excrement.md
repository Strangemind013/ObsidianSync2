- Dan wants good soup from a dumpling place

Only an idiot would wear a cloak in this heat. Under the blazing sun, sure, but Caide was just sitting in a small teahouse–and he was sweating like the last cow in a famine. His spit thickened from the fragrance of jasmine, the sharp tang of soy sauce, and the savory aroma of steamed pork. Still, he decided he wouldn’t partake. A penance, of sorts.

He didn’t regret his choice of garment half as much as his choice of company. Not very wise to still be around someone he’d just betrayed. More so to still work for him. Even more so to still be his friend.

Across from him sat Dan, chewing a mouthful of pork dumplings. He wore a fine silk robe, brightly colored, its splendor diminished by the sweat stains around the neck and armpits. The fabric stretched around his waist in a losing effort to contain his gut. He hummed tunelessly as he dipped a dumpling in soy sauce and ate it whole, blissfully ignorant of the fact that his trusted guard turned out to be quite the bastard.

Dan speared another dumpling with his chopstick. “You’re making me look like a right cunt, you know? When–”

“Look like?” Caide tilted his head. “Aren’t you already?”

Dan scoffed and shook his head as he poured a toothache amount of sugar in his tea. “I’m just saying. It makes me feel bad when you just sit there. Wouldn’t kill you to have a bite.” 

“Not hungry,” Caide said. He hadn’t eaten since dawn.

“Even when I’m paying?”

It wasn’t about the money. It would’ve been a few days ago, but it was too late now. “Wouldn’t want to owe you.” 

Dan raised an eyebrow.

“More than I have to, I mean," Caide added.

Dan chuckled. “Owe? It’s tea and dumplings, you dolt. You think I’d list it down? Charge you interest?”

Caide shrugged. “I’ll pass.” Guilt wasn’t good for one’s appetite.

Another breeze blew by, ringing the several chimes hanging about, and whistling through the gaps in the bamboo dividers of their private cubicle. He caught a whiff of smoke. Another summer fire? Nah. Someone forgot to mind the cookpot, more like. 

“Oh!” Dan squealed, eyes bright with an idea. “I have one!” 

By the gods, not another one of these.

He licked his greasy lips and composed himself, sitting upright on his floor cushion. “Would you rather be…” He grinned, pausing for effect. “Some minor noble with a perpetual itch in his ass? Or be the king, but you couldn’t hold your bowels?”

“Incredible,” Caide said. “Ever thought of being a scholar?” Still, he couldn’t help but indulge him. It was the least he could do. “Why don’t you go first, since it was your brilliant idea?”

Dan sucked noisily on his teeth, possibly retrieving a bit of pork stuffing. “Hmm. I think I’d have a go at being the king,” he said, rubbing one of his chins. “I don’t know how ruling would suit me, but having the royal chefs cook my every meal would undoubtedly make it worth the trouble.”

Caide grimaced. “You’d be shitting yourself constantly, your Royal Highness. But do enjoy your food… if you can.”

“Level with me here.” By the way Dan leaned in–stone-faced, brow furrowed, you’d’ve thought he was some great philosopher about to reveal the secret to enlightenment. “How often do we really shit, anyway? I’d only have to worry about it once a day, don’t you think?” He held up two sausage-looking fingers. “Twice, at the most.”

“Only because the rest of us could hold our shit in for tomorrow. But you won’t be doing any of that, your Lordship. It’ll pass right through you like wine through a sieve.”

Dan sipped some of his too-sweet jasmine tea, looking pensive. “I could ask the king’s healer to make me some tea, or a tonic perhaps? That might help.”

Caide chuckled, exasperated by Dan’s nonsense. “You’re putting too much thought into this.”

“Yeah, you’re right. Doesn’t matter, I’d be a shitty king anyway,” he said with a wink.

The pun wasn’t lost on Caide, but acknowledging it would be an invitation for more.

“Besides,” Dan said, “I quite like where I am right now.”

 And why wouldn’t he? Having both hands sounded wonderful.

Caide shook off a lock of hair from going in his eye. He thought of tying it back, but then he was only half-equipped for that task, wasn’t he? He scoffed at the idea of asking Dan to tie it for him. How pathetic would that be?

Dan dabbed the corners of his mouth with his silk scarf. “And you?” he said. “King or noble?”

“How bad is the itching?” Caide asked. “I think I’d find ruling too bothersome.” A useless cripple like him would hardly be inspiring to the populace. He’d spend half his reign putting down revolts.

“Just your usual itch,” Dan said, round face all serious. “Like a mosquito bite. There’s some relief after you scratch it, but it never really goes away.”

“Easy–give me noble any day. I just need the money.”

“Oh,” Dan said, crestfallen. “Still going on about that?”

“Well, yeah. You didn’t think I’d just forget about it, did you?”

Dan winced. “I was hoping you might.”

“Whatever the fuck for?” Caide asked, more sharply than he would’ve liked.

“Ever think that, maybe…” Dan hesitated. “That maybe you don’t even need it? That maybe you should just put it out of your mind?”

A woman’s shrill laugh left Caide’s ears ringing. He looked around at the teahouse’s few patrons, living their lives all happy and content with being whole.

“Dan, look at me,” he said. “You know what I am. Things that should be easy–everyday tasks–I struggle with. I don’t even need it?” He barked a harsh, humorless cackle. “You ever tried dressing yourself with one hand?” Caide looked down on his right hand and made a fist. “Then one day you tell me about Hira’s breakthrough. It can’t possibly be real, I thought. I don’t even know how it works. But it’s an arm, you said. Not just the fingers she’d been making. A real, working arm, all for the price of a small fortune! You think I could forget? You think, as I twist myself with things a child could do in his sleep, that I can just put it out of my mind?”

“Oh, alright. Calm down. Sorry I asked.” Dan had that shit-eating grin he made when he was messing with him. Shoulders up to his ears, face all puckered from trying not to giggle. “No need to get all weepy about it,” he croaked.

Gods-damned bastard.

Caide laughed, embarrassed by his sudden outburst. He swallowed the bait. One mention of the damned arm and he bristled like a petulant child. When did he get so touchy? “Fuck you, Dan.”

Dan snorted. “I did the numbers. Three thousand gold marks? That’s eighteen years of work. You’d be what? Almost fifty? By then you could just take both your hands and dig your own grave.” Dan looked him dead in the eye. “It’s you who’s fucked.”

Eighteen years. Fuck that. Caide couldn’t even wait another day. For too long he’d been up all night with an unbearable itch in his left palm. Why would a missing limb itch? He would’ve understood if it was on his stump of a shoulder. That he could scratch. But his palm?

Caide flashed him a sour smile. “I don’t suppose I could get an advance? Surely the Cardinal’s genius bookkeeper could pull something out of his perfumed bottom?”

Dan frowned. “Don’t you think I haven’t thought about it? You know I’m on your side, Caide. Always. But this…” He huffed, wiping his brow with his silk scarf. “I just count the coins, alright? As much as I’d want to–the old man would kill me. I’m sorry. I got nothing.”

Now Caide wallowed in self-pity just as much as anyone, probably more, but whenever Dan wallowed with him with that sorry look on his boyish face, he’d get an overwhelming desire to jump headfirst into the Crescent river.

Against all reason, however, he couldn’t help but hope. A childish, fool’s hope that Dan, with all his smarts, could come up with some brilliant scheme to get the money he needed. No matter. Only the weak needed help.

Three days ago, he’d gotten the money himself. All three thousand gold marks. It didn’t take much–just betraying his only friend. Sold him out like he didn’t owe him everything. Useless fucking coward. Now a traitor as well. Another addition to his list of winning qualities.

Still, he’d rather be a traitor than a cripple. A shit choice to be made, yes, but that was that.

When did life ever take it easy on him, anyway? It was always someone having to die, or getting betrayed, or having to lose an arm for nothing. Surely, after everything he’d done, he deserved better? Or maybe–he was sickened to think–he’d been getting exactly what he deserved.

No, he thought.

No one deserves anything. You get what you get.

You take what you can.

The irony tasted sour in his mouth. Dan apologized to him, when it should’ve been the other way around. Someday soon, maybe. But not today. Today was dumpling day, and he wouldn't ruin that for Dan.

“I know that, you dumb bastard.” Caide managed a grin of his own. “No need to get all weepy about it.”

“Oh, fuck off–”

Someone flipped a table over. Clay pots and teacups shattered, wooden plates and dishes rattled, startling everyone nearby. A woman shrieked, others gasped, and someone jumped out of his seat, toppled over, and crashed into what sounded like a porcelain vase on a pedestal.

Caide gestured for Dan to sit still and peeked out from a gap between the dividers.

“Please, sir. I just need more time. Business isn’t as good, and prices are–”

It was the shopkeeper. A skinny, older fellow dressed in stained, greasy work clothes. He lay splayed on the ground, looking up aghast at two seedy-looking men standing over him, all smug faces and bad intentions. Both armed–one with a cruel-looking cudgel, the other with a shortsword with a rusty hilt. A third one sat on a stool and slurped his tea with as much finesse as a landed trout. He was better dressed than the others, in a linen tunic with a vest over it.

“Come on now,” Trout said. “Why do you make us do this? You know what today is.” He drummed his knuckles on the table. “You know we’ll come knocking. Why do you insist on wasting our time?” He nodded to one of his men, who took it as a sign to uncork the large clay gourd he brought. The man grunted with the effort as he heaved, spilling black oil around him.

“Ah, such a waste.”  Trout said with a nasty, yellowing grin. ”The summer fires are looking terrible this year.”

The few remaining patrons got up and shuffled off gingerly, careful not to step on any of the oil, and even more careful not to get too close to the men that spilled it. Trout and his men were gracious enough to let them pass, even bowing mockingly to some. One by one they left, and soon the place was almost empty. Almost, save for the two dimwits dumb enough to stay in their cubicle.

“Please, sir! This is all I have!” The old man was groveling now, some parts of him doused in oil, clothes sticking to his small frame. His forehead touched the ground as he bowed to Trout.

“Shouldn’t we do something?” Dan asked in a low whisper.

“We? Don’t you mean me?”

“Isn’t this what I hired you for?”

“You hired me to guard you,” Caide said. “There’s the door. You’re not in any danger.”

“Not in any danger?” Dan hissed. “This place makes the best dumplings this side of the Crescent! Without them, what’s the point of living?”

Caide had made some dumb decisions in his day, but he thought himself wise enough not to die for some dumplings, no matter how good they were. “The best? Are you sure? I mean, it’s a big city–the city of everything, they say. Have you tried every other damned dumpling out there?” But knowing Dan, he just might have.

“Just do something!”

But what could he do? Him being Dan’s guard was just their ploy to get him on the payroll. The sword strapped to his back was little more than a prop, its steel hadn’t seen the light of day in years. He never really expected to get into a fight working for a man with no enemies. His responsibilities extended to standing behind Dan, mouth shut, and looking menacing as he went about his dealings. That was the plan, at least. No one told him anything about getting in the way of arsonists. That was hero’s work, and gods damn it he was done with that nonsense.

You never really consider how fragile you are until you’re down to five fingers.

Trout helped the shopkeeper to his feet. “Grab what you can and run off. Go on. We’re not savages. Not worth dying for, this.”

Dan seemed to disagree. He heaved his lumbering form upright with a grunt and stepped out from their cubicle with that slight limp, almost knocking down one of the dividers as he passed. “Gentlemen,” he said, “if I may interrupt.”

Crazy bastard. Those dumplings better be life-changing. Caide puffed out his cheeks and went after him.

If Trout and his men were at all startled by their sudden appearance, they made no show of it. The other two merely placed a hand on their weapons.

  

 Trout glared at them, like he was annoyed at their existence. “About time you crawled out of your little hidey-hole,” he said. He stepped aside and gestured to the door. “Just leave. This doesn’t concern you folk.”

  

“Ah,” Dan said. “But that’s where I disagree. You see, this teahouse had the perfect steam to their dumplings. Have you tried them? Not too soft, but not too chewy either.”

 “So?” The one with the cudgel sneered.

“I’m afraid that your plans will leave them… ” He looked around at all the spilled oil. “–A tad overcooked.”

Cudgel spat. “Fuck your dumplings.” 

Rusty snickered beside him, as though that was the most clever thing anyone could’ve said. Cunts. 

“Alright,” Trout intervened. “Enough chatter. Three more of my boys are waiting outside. Do I need to call them?”

A long grating whine pierced the air as Rusty drew his sword. The other gave his cudgel a few practice whirls, its hefty, metal head whooshing through the air. Solid-looking thing, that. One hit would send Caide to an even more pitiful state of cripple. It was all he could do not to wince.

“Oh, by all means,” Dan said. He seated himself on one of the nearby stools left by a patron, the teapot on the table still steaming at the spout. “Two or five… even a dozen.” Dan jerked his head at Caide. “Makes no difference to my friend here.”

 What?

Sure. No difference at all. About as much difference as drowning in the sea or in a bucket. Both left him the same amount of dead.

Times like these, Caide learned to let Dan do all the talking. So he sat beside him and poured himself some tea, trying his hardest to look bored. Never mind that his hand shook so much he almost missed the cup. Never mind that his ass clenched so tight to the point of constipation. He raised the cup to Trout, gave him a wink, and sipped.

Trout threw his head back and laughed. A loud, belly-shaking guffaw. The other two shared a look and were grinning like fools themselves. “Looks like we have ourselves a fight, boys. Think you can take him?” His smile slipped a little as he eyed Caide’s sword.

Fuck it. Coward that he was, he still wasn’t going down without a fight. He just had to be smart about it. Trout was unarmed, and didn’t look like a fighter anyway. It was just two against one. If he could take them by surprise, he might even things out before the others came. He’d worry about them later. Good. Sounded like the makings of a plan.

Caide took a deep breath and went into the Flow. A mind-state of singular, pinpoint focus. Again came the familiar flutter in his chest, its warmth spreading to every inch of his being. The world slowed down, and he perceived everything in both overwhelming clarity and intimate recognition. 

He set his sights on the most pressing threat–their weapons. The cudgel–thirty-eight inches of ash wood, tipped with a fist-sized cylinder of studded iron. Three of the twelve studs around the head were cracked or blunted. Near the middle of the haft bore a clumsy carving–a name, perhaps. The other end of the haft was wrapped in goat leather, dried and worn from sun and sweat. 

To change something, first you must understand it.

Strapped to his back was his sword that had, among others, the ‘Break’ Heraldry perfectly carved along its length. He called upon it, drew from it, and asked it to implement his will. 

You never really commanded these things. You merely asked them favors.

But what to break?

The cudgel was made almost entirely of wood. Once part of a living thing, wood was more difficult to change, to Break. What, then? Going for its studded, metal end–while a bit more achievable–would just leave a perfectly serviceable club to hit him over the head with. Hardly worth the effort.

So he set his sights on Rusty’s sword. Twenty-eight inches of–

“You, with the sword,” Dan said. “You think that’ll hold up against Line?”

Caide nearly choked on tea and spit as he got taken out of the Flow. Everything went just a little bit faster, a little bit duller, and a lot more unknown. With stinging eyes, he forced down a cough while subtly wiping a drop of tea running down his nose. 

“Did you just say Line?” Trout’s smile was fading now, turning into a scowl. “Don’t bullshit me, fat man. You mean to tell me that’s the Sunriser you have with you?”

The Sunriser and his sword, Line–the sword that could cut through anything. Sage hunter and hero of legend, frolicking in a teahouse in Lower Meroun? 

Too great a bluff even for you, Dan. Crazy bastard.

The crazy bastard shrugged. “Heroes can’t have tea?”

They all rounded on Caide and gave him the once over. Their eyes went to his faded, fraying cloak, then to the sword at his back. He met them with a dead-eyed stare. Like he couldn’t care less. Like they were nothing. Like the Sunriser would’ve done. Probably.

“What? He forget how to talk, too?” said Trout, glaring at him.

“No,” Caide said, using a calm, throaty voice he heard once from a haughty theater actor. He kept his eyes on the tea and poured himself another cup, as though he couldn’t be bothered to look at them. “But pray you only meet my words and not my blade.” He met Trout’s stare and saw his wavering resolve. “You aren’t yet worthy.”

Ridiculous. Surely these men would see right through their terribly-constructed ruse? Any moment now and this dimwitted charade would be done for.

The other two looked to their leader. Trout kept his silence, but his face betrayed a flicker of worry.

“Go on then,” Dan goaded, rubbing his hands together. “Make him earn his keep for once, would you? It’s been a while, and I’m getting tired of paying a man to do nothing.”

The two inched closer, looking back at Trout, maybe hoping for a signal. 

Discipline, restraint, and following orders were good things to have in men. Taking their eyes off Caide, even for a moment, not so much.

Caide sprung forward to meet Rusty’s half-step. He flicked his arm, throwing a clay-colored blur. The teapot shattered on Rusty’s face with a crunch, throwing his head back, spilling tea all over him. 

Caide twirled on one foot, cloak swishing, and kicked Cudgel right in the chest before he could react. He squawked as he stumbled back, dropping his weapon with a thud. He slipped on the oil he’d been so diligently spilling and fell, rolling away a few paces before crashing into a wall.

Rusty had shaken off the tea. Red-faced and growling, he reached for the hilt of his sword. Caide rolled forward, grabbed the fallen cudgel, and swung wildly to parry behind him. The haft of the cudgel connected and something crunched under the weight of his blow. 

Rusty snarled and dropped his sword, which sunk point-first into the ground. His arm stiffened, elbow turning deep purple and starting to swell. That wouldn’t be healing anytime soon. 

Caide winced. You should get a cloak.

With his sucker-punch move spent, Caide let go of the cudgel. He stepped back in a half-crouch, taut as a bowstring, hand on the hilt of his sword in what he hoped was an intimidating pose. “If I pull this out, we all die.” He glared at Trout, who looked dumbfounded, mouth hanging open. “Shall we go and meet death together?”

What the fuck did I just say? 

He shouldn’t frequent the theater as much. It was getting to his head.

Trout glowered at his men and muttered to himself. He wrinkled his forehead for a while, then sighed. “Look,” He said, hands raised in surrender. “We’re just following orders, alright? He was a few weeks behind on his payments. We were…just teaching him a lesson. Please.”

He kept his face still, but it took everything he had not to burst out laughing at the insanity of it. Were they really getting away with this?

“So you’re telling me,” Dan said, rising to his feet. “That a man is falling behind on his payments, and your first instinct is to disrupt his place of business? Take away his source of income?”

Trout opened his mouth to respond, but Dan didn’t let him get a word in. “Doesn’t seem very wise, does it? Certainly doesn’t sound like someone who should be handing out lessons.”

Cudgel came to his senses and started to get up, dusting himself off and struggling to find a wobbly footing. Rusty bent over his elbow, face all twisted, breathing quick, shallow breaths, like he was close to sobbing.

“We’re done here,” said Trout. 

Dan clapped his hands together. “Excellent choice! I’m happy we could come to an agreement.”

Cudgel snarled at them, but there was just a hint of fear in the way his brow furrowed. Caide hoped that fear was enough. Throwing a teapot, a kick to the chest, and a lucky swing. That was it. That was his move. He had nothing left up his sleeve.

Now there’s a pun for you.

Trout turned and headed for the door without another word. Rusty backed away with him, hobbling. Cudgel shot them one last glare, but otherwise followed suit. Their weapons, for all the good it did them, lay forgotten.

Caide tensed and squinted at the door, but no one else came. No sign of the three men supposedly waiting outside. Huh. Seemed they weren’t the only ones bluffing. He let out a long, shaky sigh of relief. 

“Could be worse,” he muttered. “Could be worse.”

“Indeed,” Dan said. “That went as well as it could have. You were brilliant, by the way.” He giggled. “Shall we go and meet death together? Brilliant, I say.”

Caide scoffed, shaking his head. “We got lucky, that’s all. The Sunriser? That was stupid, Dan. Even for you.”

Dan sneered at him. “Yeah? Well I think it was genius. The greater the lie, the easier it is to believe, eh? By the end there, they could’ve sworn you were the real thing. Poor fools.” 

The shopkeeper peeked from under the counter. He looked around with frantic, teary, bloodshot eyes. “Is it over?”

“I think so,” Dan said.

The shopkeeper sagged, forlorn at the state of his teahouse. “Ah, my shop…”

The place looked like the docks during typhoon season. Tables and chairs upended, some missing a leg or two. Shards of porcelain and clay strewn about. Not to mention the oil. That would take back-breaking work to mop up and scrub off. He didn’t envy the shopkeeper in the slightest.

“Well, at least it’s not ash and rubble,” Dan said. “Better clean up the oil quickly, though. Wouldn’t want another summer fire, would we?”

The shopkeeper nodded, took both of Dan’s hands in his own and bowed to him, pressing his knuckles to his forehead. “Thank you, sir. You saved me.” He turned to Caide, gratitude etched in every line of his weathered face. “Thank you. If there’s anything I could do…”

“Just keep making those tasty dumplings and we’re good,” Dan chirped. He reached into his robes, pulled out a purse, and started counting coins. “Oh, right. For earlier. That’s uh… a pot of tea, and two orders of pork dumplings.”

The shopkeeper shook his head. “Please, sir. You’ve done more than enough. You don’t need to pay here. Ever.”

Dan chuckled as he scratched his thigh. “So you’re telling me,” he said, “that you find yourself behind on your payments, and your first instinct is to hand out free dumplings?” He smiled, took the shopkeeper’s wrist, and gently placed the money in his hand.

“Doesn’t seem very wise, does it?”
