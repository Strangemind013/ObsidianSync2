Dan fought for his life climbing up the steep path. Every step a labor, every breath more elusive than the last. Why a man would willingly live atop a hill he would never understand. But the old man wanted it, and so Dan made it happen.

Caide kept pace beside him with quiet steps, holding on to a basket of peaches. He was likely drenched under that cloak himself, but unlike Dan he wasn’t panting like a sick dog. 

“So what are you saying?” Caide asked.

Dan’s brilliant idea of starting a conversation now bit him in the ass. He thought it would take away from the tedium. A pleasant distraction during a morning stroll. But the only thing it took was the wind out of him. His shoes crunched on uneven stones and paved earth, a winding road that cut through the forest of red pines and stretched upwards into the distance. Massive trees leaned every other way and formed a shady canopy high above them, letting spots of pale sunlight through. Light dappled on the forest floor among patchy grass and sharp, moss-covered rocks. The buzzing and squawking of cicadas came in rhythm with his labored breaths, with the occasional bird twittering along.

“I’m saying that in a few months,” Dan panted, “maybe half a year, I can get you the money you need.” He glanced sideways at Caide, who had a faraway look on his face. Like he wasn’t completely there. “Get that arm and stop moping around, eh?”

He didn’t really expect Caide to jump for joy, nor burst into tears. He just wasn’t like that. Still, he wasn’t expecting this, either. He looked... disappointed? A hint of regret, even. 

“You think the Cardinal would go with this plan?” Caide asked.

“I think so. I hope so.” Dan wheezed a deep breath. “We’ll see... If I don’t pass out before we get there, that is.” Damned cart. It was just his luck that it broke an axle halfway through the trail.

“Alright...” Caide nodded. “Thank you.”

“That’s it?” Dan narrowed his eyes at him. “Just the other day you were all weepy about this. What’s going on with you?”

“It’s nothing,” Caide muttered. He looked up at him and plastered a grin on his face. “I’m grateful. Truly.” He twisted his mouth in thought. “Must be the heat, I guess?”

If heat was the problem, then taking off that damned cloak should help. He’d been so stubborn with that thing. It had been black once, a few years past, but now it was frayed and faded and riddled with holes.

Dan asked Caide about it before. Why the cloak? After some time Caide just shrugged. Wouldn’t be much use as a guard if people know I’m a cripple, he said. That wasn’t the whole truth of it surely, but Dan didn’t press the issue. Everyone had their secrets. Let him have his. It was admirable, in a way, his stubborn resolve to hide his weakness from the world.

Caide caught him looking and sighed, guessing at his thoughts. “Don’t get started on the cloak now.”

“Well,” Dan said, “if you must, at least get a new one. You might not think this, but appearances do matter in our line of work. No one would take me seriously if my guard looked like some flea-bitten, unwashed vagabond.”

He didn’t mean to sound cruel, but between the ratty old cloak, the unkempt, shoulder-length hair, and the growing stubble... Well, someone had to tell him.

“No one’s taking you seriously if I took it off, either.” Caide said. He scowled down at his cloak and gave it a sniff. His scowl deepened. “But I smell your point.”

Dan was about to give up and pass out on a nearby clearing when he saw it. A patch of light at the end of the road. He summoned the last vapors of his strength and headed for the gap in the trees, gasping all the way like a man lost at sea. Soon they left the forest behind them and found themselves at the southern face of Canopy Hill, the Cardinal’s villa. Arrived at last, and not a moment too soon.

They were met by high stone walls, twice a man’s height, which enclosed a sizable area of the leveled hilltop. Inside, a designed assortment of imposing structures rose to the heavens. A meticulous assembly of tiered, sloping roofs of carefully-arranged tiles, high terraces, and massive wooden pillars, all built on a sheer stone foundation. The Cardinal’s cliffside villa wasn’t quite on the scale of the King’s Summer Palace, but its splendor wouldn’t be denied. Dan made sure of it. 

He stepped up to the front gate under a stone archway wide enough to let two carts pass side by side. He knocked with the ornate bronze knocker, carved in the shape of a severe-looking bird clasping a ring in its pointed beak.

Dan, dry of throat and weak-kneed, verged on impatience when the heavy wooden gates swung open. A woman in her forties dressed in work robes stepped out, approaching them straight-backed and with smooth, twittering steps.

“Good morning,” she said with a polite, well-practiced smile. “How may I be of service today?”

“Who are you?” Dan blurted out. He blinked and shook his head. “I’m sorry, that was rude–it’s just that I’ve never seen you before.”

“The Cardinal found it prudent,” the handmaiden said, “to make some staffing changes, sir.” She placed a hand on her chest and made a small bow. “I am Mai. It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance.”

“Right,” Dan said. “We’re here to see the old man. I’m Dan, and–”

“The second-in-command hardly needs an introduction, sir.” Mai said with a smile. “I’m well aware of who you are. Please, come in.”

They crossed the threshold of the compound and entered the main doorway of the inner wall. Mai led them to a wooden bench in the sprawling stone garden by the edge of the central courtyard. Great wooden pillars, painted black and thick as tree trunks, flanked them on all sides, casting shadows over them as it supported the square formation of buildings: the east and west wing, with the central hall in the middle, and the northern quarters peeking behind it. All with the same sloping, tiled roofs that matched those of the outer walls. A bit much for one man to live in, but the Cardinal wasn’t above displays of vanity.

“I’ll inform the Cardinal of your arrival,” Mai said. “He’s not quite ready for you yet, and I must ask you to remain here.”

“Is he well?” Dan asked. “I brought him peaches.” The old man had been a little pale the last time they met. Dan made a mental note to bring him some ginseng next time.

“I’ll make sure he gets these,” Mai said. She took the basket of peaches from Caide and bowed, backed away, and trotted off, disappearing into the central hall at the far end of the courtyard.

He and Caide shared a look.

Dan shrugged. “Age catching up to the old man, I guess?” He sat on one of the wooden benches and started massaging his thigh. “Could’ve at least brought us some tea,” he muttered.

A large, white banner hung above the doors of the central hall, calligraphic characters spelling out the word ‘Redhallow’ in masterful brushstrokes of black ink. Pennant flags hung from the massive pillars around the courtyard, each bearing the Cardinal’s sigil–a red bird.

“He sure likes his birds, doesn’t he?” Caide mused. “He couldn’t think of something more frightening? Like a tiger, maybe?”

“We weren’t going for frightening,” Dan said. “The old man wanted to wash away his past. Wanted to rub elbows with the nobility, for some reason. So I suggested he reform his image into something more... gentle.”

“So that was you? You named the Cardinal?”

“Yes,” Dan said. “I came up with the name Redhallow, too. Sounded right at the time, I guess. I was there, you know, when the organization was formed? Just a band of lowly cutpurses and con men... And a certain young dumpling thief.” He breathed in the dewy morning air that smelled faintly of incense and wisteria. “We’ve come a long way.”

Caide squinted off somewhere by the outer wall. “Be back in a bit,” he said as he stood and half-jogged towards the edge of the front gate.

Ah, of course. The stables. Caide never did miss a chance to check out some horses. Dan had no clue what was so fascinating about whispering to a horse while stroking its mane, but to each their own, he supposed. He couldn’t remember ever seeing him ride, though. Was it possible to ride with only one hand?

Personally, Dan never saw the appeal. He would assume that lugging him around would be too much for a single horse. Thank the gods for carts, though. Whoever invented them deserved all the happiness life had to offer. If only someone could drum up some sturdier axles...

Not a minute had passed when Caide’s tall form emerged from the stables. He strode hurriedly, cloak flapping in the wind. He had that nose-flared, brow-furrowed look on him that usually meant trouble.

“What’s wrong?” Dan asked as he approached.

“There’s too many horses in there.”

“It’s a stable, Caide.”

He shot him a stern look. “I’m serious. Something’s going on here. I think–” 

  

“Sir?”

  

Mai stood by the central hall’s doorway, face impassive. “The Cardinal’s ready for you now,” she called out, her voice reverberating around the courtyard. She stepped aside and beckoned Dan to enter.

“Not sure why,” Caide whispered, “but all this stinks of an ambush. I should be with you in there.”

Nonsense. Not a week had passed since he’d been here, lounging around and having tea with the old man. The Cardinal even made him promise to bring peaches the next time he dropped by. What could’ve changed in a week?

No point in worrying. The sad truth was: if the Cardinal–for whatever reason–should want him harmed, it was something he could do very little about. A fact he constantly kept at the back of his mind.

Well, Dan thought as he started to cross the stone courtyard, only one way to find out. “Be back in a bit,” he called out behind him. “Hopefully with good news.” Caide frowned at him, but sat back down anyway.

The sharp fragrance of incense struck them as they stepped into the cavernous central hall. Mai gave a droning spiel about the details of the villa, going into length about the lion statues that adorned the stone garden, and the watercolor painting of mountains that hung before them.

“Please, Mai,” Dan said. “You’re wasting your breath on me.” He flashed her his most polite smile. “You see, I built this place.” He rubbed at his chin and wrinkled his nose as he recalled. “Let’s see... We imported those statues from across the Jade sea. Silan-made, pure alabaster.” He gestured to the painting. “And I believe it was Reng Woon, who I commissioned for this one. Insufferable cunt. You might know him as the Lilyhopper.”

This place will be the death of me, the Cardinal lamented some years ago, complaining about how the city’s dusty air was choking him. The following week, Dan was surveying plots of land and consulting with builders and architects. The task took almost two years, countless laborers, the entirety of his patience, and an unspeakable amount of gold to complete. You do work in miracles, the old man said as he gazed upon his new home.

They reached the double-doors of a room by the end of the hall. A lone sentry stood by the door. Hidar, the Cardinal’s personal guard. A lean, sinewy monk in his forties, head shaved and swathed in his usual monastic garb. The garb might have been bright orange once, but it was now frayed and faded and riddled with holes. Huh. Rags must’ve been the latest fashion in personal guards. 

Hidar kept his gaze down, as usual, and might as well have been made of stone. His vow of silence was as unnerving as it was unfathomable to Dan. 

“The Cardinal is waiting for you inside,” Mai said.

“Hunched over his ledgers again, I assume?”

Hidar wordlessly pulled aside the sliding doors, bowing low. 

Dan nodded to Mai and stepped through, eager to be away from the monk. He found that Hidar’s prolonged company gave him gooseflesh, for whatever reason. Probably the silence, or maybe those sunken, unfocused eyes.

The Cardinal’s meeting chamber was an underwhelming space in an otherwise extravagant home. An almost empty room save for a row of tall shelves that lined the western wall, filled with rows of neatly-organized ledgers and scrolls. Occupying most of the room was a long table over a fine rug surrounded by floor cushions. There wasn’t much else in the way of finery and ornamentation. The intent was clear: In here we talk business, and not much else.

  

He searched for the old man, but found that he wasn’t alone. The Cardinal’s enforcers–four men that oversaw separate aspects of Redhallow’s operations, acknowledged Dan’s arrival with a nod or a raised cup. Well, the mystery of the overfull stables had been solved, at least. Now what did we have here, and how come he wasn’t invited?

At the head of the long table sat the Cardinal, lounging on a floor cushion. He wore flowing silk robes, richly embroidered, that hung loose from his lean frame. “Ahh, Dan,” he said. He took a long drag from his pipe and puffed out a cloud of white smoke. “You grace us with your presence.”

It was a rare moment indeed when Dan had nothing clever to say. “I don’t--”

The Cardinal held up a hand. “I’m sure whatever caused your delay was of the utmost importance.” He smiled warmly, arms open. “There’s no need to ponder on it.”

Delay? What was he playing at? This was an unannounced visit. Something nagged at him about all this. Had they been meeting in secret? I don’t know, but all this feels like an ambush. Maybe Caide was right.

Relax, Dan thought. You’re overthinking things again. The old man probably just forgot to send him the usual summons for a meeting. Or at least someone did, with all these staffing changes about. Just a happy coincidence that he came, anyway. He walked over and sat at the other end of the long table, his rightful place as the Cardinal’s second-in-command.

The Cardinal looked around at his men. “Anything else?”

Good. He wasn’t too late, then.

The more unsavory reports were usually withheld until the end of these gatherings. It was amusing to see these enforcers–feared leaders in their own right–sweat in their cushions as they tried to articulate their bad tidings to the old man.

Kebre, a pudgy, baggy-eyed man in his fifties, tugged at the collar of his tunic and cleared his throat. “Our next shipment of dust has been... further delayed, Your Excellency,” he said, keeping his gaze downward, as if avoiding eye contact lessened his incompetence. “The docks are being devastated by these damn summer fires... Half our warehouses are either burned down or in full capacity.” Kebre shot Dan a look, as though it was his fault.

Dan smiled to himself. It was. Well, part of it, anyway.

“I’m confused,” said the Cardinal. “Dan?”

“Yes, Your Excellency?” Dan said, sitting upright.

The Cardinal stroked his wispy beard. “The warehouses are full, he says? Enlighten me, Dan. Isn’t it simply a matter of making room? What could be a higher priority than nightdust?”

“Food,” said Dan. Now was his moment. The unveiling of his genius. He feigned at humility, lowering his gaze and hunching his shoulders. “I’m afraid I’ve taken a gamble, Your Excellency. My man at the House of Growth had given me reason to believe that this year’s crops wouldn’t meet the city’s demand.”

  

His words were met with frowns and raised eyebrows. Naturally. He wouldn’t put it past these men to be blind to the importance of his work. But the Cardinal listened with eager interest, and his was the only opinion that mattered.

  

“I’ve instructed my managers,” Dan continued, “to stockpile grain and to arrange for more to be imported.” He put a hand on his chest and made a small bow to Kebre. “I’m afraid this has left me no choice but to make some sacrifices regarding our storage. My apologies.” Dan turned to the Cardinal and looked him in the eye. “Between the crop’s weak yield and the summer fires... There might come a time where only you can meet the demands of a starving city, all while turning a profit. I weighed it against some short-term returns on contraband and made a judgment call.”

He made a conscious effort not to smirk or let any smugness show. It had taken him months, but the plan was in motion. The past summer had left Meroun on the brink of a food shortage, and this year wasn’t looking any better. Worse, in fact, since the latest census showed a marginal, yet no less significant, increase in the city’s population. Add that to the fact that the summer fires have been relentless–more devastating than he’d seen in all his years. Taking the fires into account and adjusting for its effects had been a massive headache, but he’d managed. This was going to be his masterpiece. Like the Lilyhopper with Spears to the Heavens.

Dan caught a flash of triumph in the Cardinal’s eyes. Of course. The plan was mostly to his benefit, after all. Being lowborn wasn’t a stain he’d so easily wash away, no matter how much he swaddled himself in the trappings of nobility. Should the plan come to fruition, he’d be the city’s savior. The populace would grovel at his feet. The king and his ministers would have no choice but to finally acknowledge him.

Not to mention the money to be made.

The Cardinal smiled, as he should. “Excellent,” he said. “You see, gentlemen? This is what I require of you. Cunning plans and decisive action.” He raised his cup to Dan before taking another drink. “You do work in miracles, as always. I assume everything has been arranged?”

“Yes, Your Excellency,” Dan said. “My managers have been set to task. If everything goes as planned, I wouldn’t even have to lift a finger.”

“Excellent. Meet with them at once,” said the Cardinal. “Have them cease their stockpiling operations and clear the warehouses. Make space for the coming shipments of nightdust, even if it means selling the grain at a loss. Proceed with the importation, but with staggered orders. Keep it down to twenty to thirty cartloads per week and have it sold immediately.”

“I don’t understand,” said Dan. These changes would undermine the whole objective. Why would he want that? The city is going to starve. It was a fact. Not something he could negotiate with.

“Which of my instructions were unclear?” said the Cardinal, the beginnings of a sneer on his lips. “I admire your spirit Dan, but this plan of yours... I’m afraid it betrays your ignorance.”

The other enforcers nodded along with various stages of glee on their faces. Of course they did. Dan was being humbled in embarrassing fashion, after years of being the only one with a functioning brain. He could only imagine how satisfied they must be. Fools, the lot of them.

The Cardinal held up his glass and Matta–the enforcer in charge of logistics–was quickly by his side. It would appear that his duties extended to the immediate and successful arrival of wine in the Cardinal’s cup. 

The old man downed it in one gulp. “You think it wise to deprive this city of nightdust?” he said. “How long has it been? Almost a week since our stocks ran out?”

Kebre nodded. “Yes, Your Excellency.”

“These people are addicted, Dan. You think starvation is a problem?” The Cardinal shook his head. “You haven’t seen what happens to a man when you take away his dust.”

So that was it, then? Let the rest of us starve just so these degenerate dustheads could take another hit? If anything had to be burned down by the summer fires, it should be these damned smoking dens–along with the dustheads in them.

“I see,” Dan said, taking a small bow. “As you wish, Your Excellency.” What more could he say? The Cardinal had a habit of taking any reasonable argument as a personal offense.

“Good,” he said. “You know, I’ve been thinking, Dan.”

Thinking, was he? Nothing good ever came of that. Letting Dan do the thinking for him was one of the wisest decisions he’d ever made. Dan braced himself. Whatever came next would surely be another headache he’d have to deal with.

“I believe I’ve found a better use of your time,” the Cardinal said. “I’ve realized that a man of your prodigious intelligence is being wasted on the governing of my lowly enterprise. I’m giving you another task. Something worthy of your talents.” The old man flashed a yellowing smile. “You do work in miracles, after all.”

Another task? What could be more important than–

No. Something must’ve happened. Something beyond his knowledge. Was he being punished? Why would the old man do this? 

“Before the summer is done,” the Cardinal continued. “You will turn over all your duties and properties back to me. The ownership of the ships, the trading company, the warehouses, all the rest. I’m not so ancient as to be helpless just yet.” The Cardinal thought for a moment. “On second thought, keep the tavern. The gods know there’s little profit to be made from that hovel,” he said, much to the enforcers’ delight. “Consider it a gift.”

The bastard had a way with words. An uncanny ability to sound several lifetimes wiser than he actually was. Ungrateful old man. He’d been a lowly con man when they first met. How dare he? He was nothing more than a figurehead. A scarecrow. The most vicious rat in the gutter. 

With his own cunning and acumen, it was Dan who built this lowly enterprise.

*Without me, you’d’ve died in the muck, Your Excellency.*

And now, after all was said and done, he was being cast aside? And for what? For being late? For taking up storage? For having an excellent plan?

Fuck it. He’d sooner burn this whole thing to the ground.

“As you wish, Your Excellency,” Dan said through gritted teeth.

The Cardinal took another drink. “Oh, and as for your task: Do something about these damn summer fires, would you? Before everything I’ve built turns to ash. One would be inclined to think that the Summer God is exacting vengeance on me, for whatever reason.”

The enforcers’ puzzled looks reflected his own confusion. Do what, exactly? Every year, the people of Meroun endured the summer fires, though it was something one mostly heard about in passing. Oh, another house burned down. Too bad. Thank the Summer God it wasn’t mine.

Sure, sometimes crazy bastards decided upon themselves to start their own fires, like the other day at the teahouse, but there was little to be done about that. You just prayed to the Summer God and hoped to be spared. Otherwise, just run away with your life and anything you could carry.

He heard from a drunk the other day that the fires were Summer God’s way of punishing Meroun for its hubris and debauchery. Should he shut down every smoking den, brothel, and gambling house in the city, then? Maybe he should build the Summer God a statue, or perhaps offer a goat as a sacrifice? Perhaps he could find him, grab him by the neck, and tell him to stop? Dan nearly laughed at the utter nonsense.

“I’ll look into it, Your Excellency.”

“Good, good,” the Cardinal said. “If there’s nothing else... “ He waved them off. The meeting was done.

Dan had barely gotten up on one knee when the Cardinal snapped his fingers at him. 

“No,” he said. “Not you. We still have more to discuss.” The rest of the enforcers shuffled off without a backwards glance, muttering amongst themselves. The door shut behind them.

It wasn’t unusual for Dan to stay behind after these meetings, but right now, he wanted nothing more than to get away from this bastard. He plopped down on the floor anyway.

Perhaps the old man would offer an explanation? Maybe it was just part of a scheme, or a trick, and he’d be letting him in on the plan. Anything that would explain why he was being stripped of everything, because he was damn well out of ideas.

“So,” the Cardinal said. He took one last puff from his pipe and set it down. “Out of the love I had for you, I’m giving you a chance to explain.”

Explain what? If anything, it was Dan who was owed an explanation. “I don’t know what you think I did, but--”

The Cardinal slammed his fist on the table. His pipe twirled in the air, scattering ashes before clattering off somewhere. The liquor bottle rolled off the edge of the long table, spilling cloudy-white wine in its wake.

“Don’t,” he said in a tight-lipped, gritted-teeth whisper. “Don’t further insult me by denying it.”

Dan forced in a slow, deep breath. Stubborn, pig-headed, close-minded, son of a whore. There was no reasoning with him. 

“Humor me, will you?” Dan said, struggling to keep his voice level. “Just this once. Tell me, what the fuck,” he hissed, “did I do that displeases you so?”

Dan bit his tongue. He might’ve overstepped himself. But the old man simply frowned.

“I made a friend the other day,” he mused. “A young inspector from the Department of Lessons. I represent the Head Lector’s interests, he said. Pompous, self-righteous bastard.” 

An inspector? What does this have to do with anything? The ministries wouldn’t dare come after Redhallow, would they? They knew the consequences.

“This bastard have a name?” 

”The Cardinal thought for a moment. “He said his name was Sahin Abaya, if I’m not mistaken.”

“I know of him,” Dan said. “A hand-fucker, if I ever saw one. He’s well beyond his depth here, Your Excellency. You shouldn’t even concern yourself with this rat. I’ll deal with him.”

The Cardinal reached into his robes, pulled out a folded sheet of paper, and flicked it towards Dan. “Haven’t you already?”

Dan snatched the paper and unfolded it.

How…?

In his hand was a list of names and numbers. It was a transcribed copy, but he recalled writing this himself. It was a page from his secret ledger–a comprehensive account of bribes given to each of their “friends” from the government.

Impossible. No one should even know about this. Writing it was something he’d debated against himself many times, but he had no choice. There had been no way to keep track. He couldn’t possibly remember everything. 

  

But he’d been careful, hadn’t he? It was kept inconspicuously labeled among identical books in his private study, which he made sure was locked at all times. He fingered the key hanging from his neck. How did anyone else get in? Much less an inspector, of all people?

  

With this they were vulnerable. Open to accusation, and with proof in writing. Does the Head Lector already have a copy? He was a man known for his relentless pursuit of corruption. A paragon of integrity, or so they said.

Maybe Sayin Abaya was just looking to be bribed? It was more likely that he would act in service of himself. Good. The Head Lector was one thing, but a mere inspector he could manage.

“It seems I have my own rats to deal with,” Dan said. “I can still fix this, Your Excellency. Let me handle it.” 

“Spin all the tales you wish.” The Cardinal shrugged. “The fact remains--I have no use for traitors.”

“You truly think I did this?” Dan challenged, his voice full and resounding. “Then why am I still alive? You should’ve sent Hidar after me. What was that thing you were so fond of saying? A traitor expects no mercy, nor does he deserve it.”

“I’m well aware,” he said softly, “of what you’ve given to this organization. Of the things you’ve made possible. There will be no attempts on your life, Dan. Consider this my gratitude.”

“So this is what your gratitude looks like?” Dan scoffed. “Twenty years of loyalty, and my guilt wasn’t even up for debate? Your Excellency, I’d rather you slit my throat right now!”

For a moment, Dan thought he saw the Cardinal waver. A slip of his Redhallow mask, decades long in the making. He knew Dan was right. How could he not? There was no reason for him to do this. 

You can’t lose me, or else the rest of your dogs will eat each other, fighting for my place at your heel. 

The old man still needed him. Therein laid his chance.

“Loyalty, you say?” the Cardinal said. “There was a time when I thought I knew loyalty. Find someone with nothing, and make him owe you everything, I thought.” The Cardinal looked him in the eye. “But I was mistaken. I have no one to blame but myself. I’ve been too generous with you, and now you believe you’re beyond me. A shame. Think of what we could’ve achieved together, Dan. We could’ve brought this city to heel, if not for your hubris and greed.”

Dan sighed. “Then there’s nothing more to be said.” Nothing more that he wouldn’t regret, anyway. He heaved himself, stood upright, and bowed to the Cardinal. “By your leave, Your Excellency.”

It would seem that the Cardinal was determined to be rid of him. At the very least, he still limped away with his life. It was more than he could say for the rest of Redhallow’s enemies. He was safe for now–if this old bastard could be trusted. Maybe Caide would have something to do for once. That scuffle the other day at the teahouse was promising, but against Hidar? 

The Cardinal waved him off, not even sparing him a glance.

And that, right there, was the shit of it. How could he throw him away so easily? Didn’t he deserve another chance, at the very least? Was he not–

*Fuck this,* Dan thought. He turned for the door with all the calm he could muster.

*Think of what we could’ve achieved, was it?*

*What you fail to understand, old man, is that you were holding me back.*
