It just occurred to Dan that tables, however mundane, had always been an integral part of his life. He ate his fill on a table, wrote his ledgers on a table, counted his gold on a table. A slab of wood and four legs. So useful, so dependable. Sure, you might stub your toe on one from time to time, but a small price to pay in the grand scheme of things. The same could be said about chairs, particularly this one that he’d been thoroughly enjoying.

Dan raised his teacup off the small, polished tabletop, still dewy from last night’s fog, and took a sip. Too sweet. He liked it that way, of course. Stirred with just enough honey to insult an entire beehive.

The eastern courtyard of Canopy Hill, a villa built on a leveled mountaintop, glistened with beaded morning dew. And what a sight it was–a stone-tile footpath snaked across a meticulously-arranged rock garden, flanked with young maple trees, its peach-colored leaves swaying in the crisp morning breeze. 

As if that wasn’t painterly enough, beyond the garden, hundreds of feet far below, a patchwork of golden rice fields stretched far as the eye can see. At its heart stood the walled city of Meroun, the city of everything. Built on a hill that sloped down to the eastern bank of the Crescent river, it had become the center of trade and culture this side of the world. A city of unbridled indulgence.

However, this grand view was only made possible by having the outer edge of the courtyard end over a sheer cliff face. It niggled at him, this ever-present danger. Some idiot could stumble off to his death at any time. Dan argued for walls, at the very least, but the architect had been adamant. *You wanted a home fit for royalty,* the architect said. *Do not occupy it with fools.*

All that effort just for something nice to look at. 

Dan would’ve allowed himself to enjoy it more, he admitted, if only he wasn’t painfully aware of what it had cost them to get there. But nothing worth having was achieved without hard work, and hard work was exactly what it took. That, and sacrifice. And blood. And an unimaginable amount of ruthlessness.
