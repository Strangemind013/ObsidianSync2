Dan might’ve rubbed his temple down to the bone from all the shit he had to deal with today. One after the other, issues and disputes appeared before him, expecting him to provide a solution. A never-ending series of headaches. Some minister’s son hadn’t come home for a month, sisters quarreling over inheritance, and a desperate man seeking to prove his wife’s adultery. All favors asked of the Cardinal–supposed champion of the poor and helper of the needy. A friend to all.

If only they knew.

A scattering of papers, scrolls, and open ledgers rustled in the breeze around his low writing desk–heralds of dire tidings brought on by getting kicked out of Redhallow. A quick look at his finances showed a wince-inducing lack of personal wealth. As it turned out, he never really owned anything. He’d simply been managing and growing the Cardinal’s wealth all these years. And look where it got him.

A knock on the door from Daril cut his musings short. Another one? The sunlight filtering in from the window had been turning to that almost-dinner shade of orange. This better be quick. He’d been here all day, and his stomach was complaining. “Come in,” Dan said with a sigh. The one at the door, however, proved to be a pleasant surprise.

Meita, famed courtesan of Snowdrop Garden, entered [The Tavern’s] pantry-turned-study. The woman was a vision straight out of a masterwork painting–dressed in fine, painted silk robes the color of cherry blossoms. She glided the dusty stone floor, stood in front of Dan, and bowed gracefully at the waist. “Young master Dan,” she said, “Thank you for having me.”

Damn. Even her voice? A lilting breeze, haunting enough to touch a man’s soul. She spoke in impeccable fashion as well–syllables perfectly spaced and intoned, in a steady hush just above a whisper. A trademark of the Garden’s courtesans, trained in the strictest etiquette. Still, Dan caught a slight twinge, a barely audible crack in the way she spoke. Something bothered the poor woman, though it didn’t show on her face, immaculate in its rose-blush cheeks and scarlet lips. Only her heavy-lidded eyes betrayed any sign of her troubles–puffy and with just a hint of redness, likely from a night spent in tears.

Dan, still seated, bowed in return. “I’d get up,” he said with an apologetic grimace, “but it’d take too long. Please, sit.” He caught a whiff of lily nectar perfume, a momentary reprieve from the former pantry’s persistent aged-meat smell.

Meita sat down, folding her legs in effortless elegance, painfully out of place in the shabby, makeshift excuse for a study. Like a lotus flower in a latrine.

The sight of her had been blinding–like staring at the sun–yet Dan wouldn’t dare look away. He didn’t think that beauty of such amounts could be purely distilled into one person.

He gathered sheaves of paper into a neat stack on his desk in a futile effort at tidying the space. A bit rude not to offer some tea, but he figured she didn’t come all this way for refreshment. “Look,” he said, “in the interest of time, I’ll forego the pleasantries. Let’s hear what you have to say.”

Meita cleared her throat and nodded. “I understand.” She reached forward and gently took Dan’s hand in her own, pressing his knuckles to her forehead. “Thank you for your help last night, young master. I–”

Dan’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. “Ah,” he stammered, gingerly pulling his hand back as heat rushed through his cheeks. Meita’s hands were absurdly soft and pleasantly warm, like smoke made flesh. “Truth be told,” Dan said, “I barely did anything. Just gave some orders. More importantly, it’s the Cardinal’s influence and means that made it possible.”

I do all the work, and the Cardinal gets all the flowers.

Wouldn’t be the worst idea to stop acting in the old man’s best interest, but what else could he do? He had to redeem himself, no matter what it required. Surely the Cardinal would realize how indispensable he was. Maybe he already did, and was merely too stubborn to admit it. It would then be up to Dan to give him an excuse. An undeniable reason to take him back.

Meita’s mouth twisted in a pained smile–one that could get a moneylender to consider philanthropy. She took a deep, shuddering breath, eyes brimming with tears. “I swear I don’t know what happened. I woke up and he’s–” She bit on her lip and choked down a sob.

“Did he hurt you?”

“No... I don’t know. The night had been uneventful–I served drinks, played the lute, and sang for him... The next thing I remember is waking up next to his lifeless body. You have to believe me, young master Dan. I didn’t do anything.”

“I do believe you,” Dan said. “How could I not? He’s just a lowly merchant, neither rich nor powerful enough to even bother killing. Nevertheless, someone did, and whoever’s done it wanted you to take the fall.”

Meita looked at him beseechingly. “Pardon my impertinence, young master, but I have to ask–how can you believe me so easily? I’m grateful, surely, but my heart still quivers with unease. Is it possible that I could’ve..?”

Dan considered himself a man of reason, of logic and truth, and so let these virtues direct his every choice. But the sight of Meita in the brink of tears compelled him, beyond comprehension, to provide any sort of comfort. Whatever desperate string of words that could fall out of his mouth, so long as it eased her pain even a miniscule amount. Fortunately, he didn’t have to think too hard on it.

“As it so happens,” he said, “I had to make sure as well. We had the body brought to a coroner, and the autopsy revealed traces of a particularly rare kind of poison. Nasty stuff, I’ll spare you the details.” He flashed his most encouraging smile. “Now you wouldn’t have a couple of desert scorpions lying around, would you?”

“No, I do not.” Meita sighed, her face awash with relief. “Then..?”

“You’re as pure as fresh fallen snow,” Dan said with a wink. “In that regard, at least.”

With a hand over her mouth, Meita giggled–a lovely sound, like chimes in a morning breeze. Dan suspected that it had little to do with mirth, but rather a well-rehearsed response.

“But we’re not out of the woods yet,” Dan said. “A man has died in your company–that’s a fact. We’re certain of your innocence, yes, but some precautions must still be taken.”

A crease formed on Meita’s forehead. “What should I do?” she asked, her soft features immediately reflecting her concern. Should her days as a courtesan come to an end, she’d do splendidly as an actress.

“That’s the easy part,” Dan said. “Simply carry on with your life as usual. It’s the changes that would cause suspicion. If you have travel plans, then my apologies–but you will have to cancel them.”

Meita nodded, eyes downcast, failing to hide a small frown.

“And one more thing,” Dan continued. “The men I sent to... ah, clean house, didn’t do so by the generosity of their hearts. In fact, they’re specialists–doing all manner of odd jobs, which, fortunately for us, includes taking care of a body. They work quickly, discretely, and most importantly, they keep their mouths shut. Thing is, they don’t come cheap. And as you can see,” Dan smiled sheepishly and waved at his surroundings. “I’m ill-equipped to be of help in that regard.”

“I’d hate to trouble you, young master. I do have some money saved up.”

“Three hundred gold marks?”

Her eyes widened. “Oh.”

“Not to worry,” Dan said. “I’ve spoken with Aunt Tahede–she’s agreed to cover the expenses for now. But we both know that she’s not much for charity, so I’ve arranged some terms. She’d be deducting a third of your pay for a year, maybe two, until the debt is paid. Sound fair?”

“I...” She thought for a moment, then fixed a resolute expression. “Yes, young master, that is fair.”

“It’s not ideal, I know. But given the circumstances, it’s the best we could manage.”

“No, please. It is more than I deserve.” Meita took a deep bow, her forehead touching the floor. “I cannot thank you enough, young master.”

Dan shook his head. “No, I am simply a servant. What I do, I do in service of His Excellency. Always remember that this is his doing, and so deserves all the praise. I wouldn’t mention this to him, though–I’m afraid that he is burdened by gratitude. Now,” he said, clapping his hands together, “I believe our time together has come to an end. Kindly send in Aunt Tahede after you. I believe she’d want a word.”

“Of course,” Meita said. She got up and took one last bow. “I hope you come visit me soon. I’ll take good care of you, just like you did for me.”

“Ah,” Dan said with a timid smile. “But my lady, I believe I’ve just earned your respect. Wouldn’t want to throw it all away by disrobing.”

She smiled back at him, hopefully a real one this time. “Goodbye, young master.”

#

Dan suspected that Aunt Tahede must have been a woman of breathtaking beauty in her youth–the Meita of her day. A few decades ago perhaps, but there still remained traces of said beauty even as she glared at Dan with silent contempt. 

Though admittedly, it was one of the rare instances where Dan deserved it.

“You set this up,” Aunt Tahede said in the same soft manner as Meita. Softer, even. A paragon of etiquette. “You said he would convince her. But now he’s dead. Dead! Any in my Garden, no less!”

So if he died some other place, it wouldn't matter?

Aunt Tahede regained her mask of calm, though her nostrils flared ever-so-slightly, and a vein in her forehead spasmed. “Killing a man in my Garden? Risking the sanctity of my house? This was all your doing. I know it. Do not make the mistake of thinking this will go unanswered.”

Dan frowned as he rubbed the gooseflesh on his arm. He should have laughed her off, but her words, said in such a calm manner, had a jarring effect. Had more bite to it. “No need for threats,” he said. “We’ve worked together splendidly in the past, Aunt Tahede, and I have no intention of getting on your bad side. I’m sure whatever ire you have for me is brought only by a simple misunderstanding.”

“I do not see how a man with no pulse could be misunderstood as anything other than dead.”

If only she knew the challenges of planning a murder. Every detail of last night’s events were painstakingly arranged, with multiple contingencies in case things went south. Luckily for them, everything went off without so much as a hitch. Now it was up to him to tidy up loose ends, particularly these two women.

“In the far south,” Dan said, “there is a rare desert scorpion called the Arak-gan. It is feared by the southerners for its venom. You got stung, you die, end of story. The truth, however, turns out to be much more interesting. See, the Arak-gan’s venom merely slowed one’s heartbeat. Slow enough that it could be mistaken, as you did last night, for death. The poison kills you eventually, of course.” Dan procured a small vial from his robes and shook it, the few remaining drops of gray liquid sloshing inside. “But not if you have the antidote.”

“Then the merchant–he lives?” Aunt Tahede tried her damnedest to remain calm, but terror seeped into her words. “Is he awake? I must speak to him immediately.”

Of course. Her eagerness wasn’t to ascertain the merchant’s well-being, but rather to make sure he wouldn’t slander the Garden at the closest opportunity. She’d sooner strangle him in his sickbed herself if it meant the Garden’s reputation remained untarnished. 

  

The things people would do to hold on to power… Then again, was he so different?

  

“Well, yes and no,” Dan said with a sly grin. “He’s alive, sure, but was no merchant to begin with. He is, in fact, an actor. A member of the Lin-lang–a roving troupe that’s just wrapped up their final show in the city.”

“An actor? That’s hardly important right now, is it? Tell me where he is. His profession doesn’t–” Aunt Tahede paused in thought for a while, then gasped quietly. A spark glinted in her eye as realization struck. “It can’t be… They were actors, weren’t they? All of them. This merchant of yours, even those who came and took him away… You,” she said, peering up at Dan with a curious expression. “You planned all of this, didn’t you? An elaborate and cunning deceit.”

To think she figured it out with just a few hints. Impressive. As expected of the Lady of Snowdrop Garden.

“I prefer to think of it more as theatrics,” Dan said. “A little show for our hesitant friend, hopefully convincing her to remain at your employ.”

“But at what cost?” Aunt Tahede asked. “You saw her just now–the poor girl is distraught. Surely she didn’t deserve such cruelty?”

Of course she didn’t, Dan thought. But more importantly, you’re afraid I broke her.

“It’s what you asked, isn’t it?”

Aunt Tahede’s cheek twitched, her mouth pressed in a hard line. It had been a week since she met with Dan, full of woe about her most precious and sought-after courtesan. Meita had expressed her desire for retirement, just when her talents and womanly allure were at its peak. Aunt Tahede was having none of it, of course, but couldn’t make an outright refusal. She needed to keep her happy–Snowdrop Garden prided itself on not only the most beautiful and skilled courtesans, but also the most pleasant in demeanor. Meita’s despair would poison her work, and that simply wouldn’t do.

“Not like this...” Aunt Tahede said. “I just need her until a suitable replacement is ready. You’ve made her stay, sure, but she would be of no use to anyone, least of all the Garden, if she’s wracked by guilt over killing a man. She’s the kind of flower that doesn’t come by often, you know? Beauty, wits, and skilled in every art that counts. Something worth fighting for, at the least.” She sighed, the dusk shadows tracing the fine lines of her face. “Maybe it wouldn’t matter anyway. Wounds of the mind leave the ugliest scars, I’ve found.”

Dan chuckled. “Didn’t think you were much for sentiment, my lady. But honestly, did you really think I’d break your precious flower?”

“Oh, don’t be coy. Speak, young master, you clearly have more to say.”

“Picture this,” Dan said, “After an evening of entertaining a client, a courtesan wakes up in the middle of the night next to said client’s dead body, presumably poisoned. She keeps her wits about her and doesn’t panic, then proceeds to secretly inform the Lady of the Garden about it. Wisely done, good job Meita. Both women find themselves in a desperate situation, seemingly with no way out. Suddenly, the Lady remembers a recent conversation she had with a clever young man. If you ever need anything, send for me, he said. And so she did. This clever young man–that’s me, if you haven’t noticed–dispatches a couple of tough-looking men who quietly take the body away, and so the night is saved. You with me so far?”

“I’m with you so far,” she said. “But what if I didn’t send for you? What if I kept still, or tried to hide the body myself?”

“Oh, that would be highly unlikely, don’t you think?” Dan shrugged. “Even so, I was just waiting outside the premises. Should you take too long to decide, I would’ve knocked on your gates and demanded to see you under some pretense. You would’ve had no choice but to ask me for help, regardless. And so the plan goes on. Satisfied? Good. Now, shall I continue my gripping tale?”

Aunt Tahede nodded, eyes closed and breathing slow, deep breaths, clearly at the end of her patience.

“Back to our poor courtesan friend, who is now weeping in her chambers. Did she do it? Is she somehow responsible for this merchant’s death? She couldn’t quite remember–there is a gap in her memory. How, you ask? Maybe because she was knocked unconscious by a pill that was slipped in her drink by her client, the merchant.” Dan pointed to himself. “I gave him the pill, by the way. None of this was an accident.”  
  
“Of course, young master. How brilliant of you,” Aunt Tahede said dryly.

Dan smiled and bowed with a flourish. “So, where were we? Right. Our tragic courtesan cries herself to sleep somehow. The following day, she and the Lady of the Garden go forth to show their gratitude and pay respects to this clever young man who so gallantly saved them by telling others what to do. And what a delight he was, this clever young man! He took the initiative and had the corpse autopsied. Turns out, a rare kind of poison was used on the merchant, something she couldn’t possibly acquire by herself. What a charming development! One that removes any doubt of her innocence and absolves her of guilt, and the inconveniences to her employer it would’ve caused.”

The Lady sniffed. “Did she truly believe all that?”

Dan’s mouth twisted into a wry, crooked smile. “It’s amusing how you underestimate me at every turn, Aunt Tahede. You’ll find me sufficiently persuasive when the need arises, and I can say with certainty that I’ve convinced her. She will have doubts, sure, but I’ve thrown her a rope. An escape. I think she’d choose to believe it regardless, considering the alternative. Wouldn’t you agree?”

One would rather believe the convenient lie than the ugly truth. And judging by the way her face softened, Aunt Tahede felt the same. “An excellent plan, I must admit,” she said with just a hint of a sneer. “You’ve overlooked a small matter, though. Nothing has changed. If anything, this unfortunate incident would only serve to drive her away quicker.”

“That is a fair point,” Dan said, nodding. “Except at the end of this thrilling story, our recently relieved and guilt-free courtesan now finds herself with a dilemma. She wants to retire, but a sudden career change would no doubt arouse suspicion. To add to that, the men that the clever young man sent, she has no idea they were this costly! Three hundred marks not only for their swift services, but also for their silence. Her employer, the illustrious Lady of the Garden, will be forced to deduct a third of her salary for a year or two, just to regain the expense that she so generously covered. Hopefully this gives the Lady enough time to train a suitable replacement.”

Aunt Tahede pursed her lips in thought, likely trying to poke holes in his ruse. After some time, she sighed. “You’re a cunning man, young master.”

“You say that like it’s a bad thing,” Dan said. “But do I not simply provide opportunities? I see a group of passionate actors devoted to their craft, so I offer them an exceptionally challenging role and the means to play it well. You should’ve seen them–they couldn’t be more thrilled. Come to think of it, I believe we’re similar in that regard. We see the potential in others and we give them a chance to rise above themselves. Now if that’s what it means to be cunning, then so be it.”

“I suppose I should pay you back the gold from hiring these passionate actors?”

“Ordinarily,” Dan said, “the honor of being at your service would’ve been enough, but the times haven’t been kind, as you can see…”

Ordinarily, Dan would’ve told the truth. The Lin-lang owed the Cardinal a favor, and refused any sort of payment. But he needed the money, now more than ever.

Aunt Tahede bowed low, her forehead touching the floor. “Please accept my apologies, young master–for my unwarranted hostility. You were right. It was simply a misunderstanding. Thank you for your invaluable assistance,” She gave a well-practiced smile, something meant to emulate warmth and motherly affection, by the looks of it. “I am fortunate to be your friend.”

Dan shook his head. “No, I am simply a servant. What I do, I do in service of His Excellency. Always remember that this is his doing, and so deserves all the praise.”

“Of course,” Aunt Tahede said with a glint in her eye. “I’d do well to remember.”

“Now,” Dan said, clapping his hands together. “Would that be all?”

#

Dan’s stomach grumbled from the persistent smell of meat in the room, like it was taunting him. The rest of Meroun had been rationing food–the least he could do was go a few hours without chewing something. The sun had well and truly set when Daril came in to light a few candles at his desk. His head throbbed. It had been doing all day. No matter, just a few more things to take care of and he’d be off to dinner.

“Thank you,” Dan said as Daril shuffled off towards the door. “Has Caide returned?”

“Not yet, boss.”

“I see. Then kindly ask Seyla if I could have a word.”

After some time, Daril returned with Seyla in tow and guided her to sit before Dan. The steward laid Seyla’s walking staff beside her, made a small bow, and left.

“You wanted to talk, boss?” Seyla said.

No, he didn’t. But he had to, and now was as good a time as any. Had there ever been a right time to break bad news?

“I trust you’ve been well, Seyla? Forgive me for calling you so late, but there’s something I needed to discuss with you.”

“Come on now, don’t be shy. You’re probably late for dinner somewhere.”

“Right,” Dan chuckled. He’d been pussyfooting, and it was just like Seyla to call him out for it. He cleared his throat. “There’s no way around this, so I’ll just say it. I’m sorry, but I’ll have to let you go. Plans have changed, and I can no longer maintain your services. I’ll also need you to move out as soon as I find somewhere you can stay.”

“Ah,” Seyla said. “Well as long as you’re sorry, that makes it all better, eh?” She sighed and slapped her knee. “Can’t say I didn’t smell this coming, though, with the state of [The Tavern] and all that. Is that why the perfumed lady was here? You turning this place into a brothel?”

“What? No... She was a courtesan, not some common dockside wh–” Dan pinched the bridge of his nose as his head throbbed again. “She was here to discuss business, alright? Point is, I’ve decided to close down [The Tavern], and will be using the establishment for something else. And no, not a brothel.”

“Alright,” Seyla said, nodding. “I hear you. But do you really have to send me away? I quite like living here. Learned all the number of steps needed to get around, you know? Thirty-four steps northeast to the nearest noodle place. Eighty-two steps west to the butcher shop, which is right beside that nice lady that sells fruit. Gives me great discounts every time, and I’m not even haggling.” She shrugged and hung her head. “Must’ve pitied the poor, blind girl.”

Dan threw his head back and laughed. “Oh, don’t pout. Everyone knows you can get around no problem. They even call you ‘alley cat,’ from what I’ve heard.”

Seyla grinned back. “Hey look, I’m about to get kicked out–it was worth a try. Thing is, whatever you’re planning to do with this place, couldn’t you use some music in it? I’m no courtesan, but I think I’m getting better with the harp-zither, and my singing’s not half-bad, if I do say so myself.”

Dan puffed his cheeks and let out a breath. “It’s not even about that,” he said. “It’s more of a safety concern. In the following weeks, there would be an influx of strangers staying here, and some, if not most, might not be as well-mannered as I would like. It wouldn’t be an ideal residence for a young lady such as you.”

“Such as me?” Seyla gasped. One of her eyebrows, though obscured by a blindfold, was undoubtedly raised judging by her tone. “I didn’t know you looked down on the blind like this. I…

Dan winced. “Wh– I only meant...” He shifted uneasily in his cushion as he struggled to cough up the right words. “It wouldn’t be very safe for *any* young lady to live here, is what I’m saying.”

Seyla snorted and doubled over, cackling. “Alright, relax. I get what you’re saying. I’m grateful for what you boys do for me, truly. Your helping hands make life easier. But I will say this–I can take care of myself. Always have, long before we met. And admittedly,” she wagged a finger at him, “it’s a touch insulting that you don’t think the same.”

“Ah,” Dan said. “You have a point there.” Looking back, maybe he had been treating her like some fragile, helpless child. Had he been, like the fruit vendor, pitying the poor, blind girl? It struck him that his absentminded attempts at empathy might’ve just been burdensome, and not entirely for her benefit. For someone accused of being cunning, he could be completely ignorant at times. “Fine,” he said. “Stay. But you really do have to look for work elsewhere. I’ll ask around. I’m sure someone out there needs a half-decent musician.”

“That works,” Seyla chirped. “I suppose I should pay rent now, as I’m no longer under your employ?”

“Awfully generous for someone who just lost her job. You sure you can afford it right now?”

“There you go underestimating me again,” Seyla said. “You’ll be surprised to know that my stint here was mostly for the free lodging. I have a more... *lucrative* trade elsewhere.”

“Oh?” Dan said. “Do tell. This should be interesting.”

“It’s simple. I wake up real early–and I mean ‘it’s still dark’ early–and I just play my harp-zither in some random pub, tavern, or brothel. I pick a loud, plucky song, throw a warble in there or two, and soon enough the hungover patrons rouse from their drunken stupor, reach into their pockets, and pay me to piss off. Easy pickings, eh? Don’t mean to brag, but I’m probably richer than you right now.”

Dan gave a hearty chuckle as he shook his head. “Alright, then. If you insist. And I’ll have Daril fit a better lock on your door.”

“That would be much obliged, thanks.”

“Right,” Dan said. “I guess that would be all. You need help walking out?”

Seyla groped around for her walking staff, gripped it with both hands, and stood up. “Nah,” she said.

“Good. Now piss off.”

She grinned as she turned for the door, her walking staff tapping the ground before her. “Good night, boss.”

#

“Hey.”

“Hmm?” Dan rubbed his eyes and stifled a yawn. He rubbed at his temple–damned headache flaring up again from a nap cut short. “How’d it go?”

“Here.” Caide dropped a thick, ledger-sized envelope on his desk. “Whatever this is.”

“Just a bit of light reading,” Dan said as he picked up the envelope and tucked it between ledgers on a shelf. “I’ll take a look tomorrow. Have a seat, will you? I have something to discuss.”

Caide reached around behind him and picked at something under his cloak. “A moment,” he grunted. He unfastened a strap at his hip and brought out a bamboo food box from under his cloak. “Figured you’d be hungry by now.”

“Oh...” Dan said as he took the stacked food box, placed it on his desk, and lifted the topmost lid. Steam and the glorious fragrance of pork dumplings wafted out. His eyes turned misty from the steam, and from something else besides. “You’re a miracle,” he croaked.

“Relax, it’s just dumplings,” Caide said, pulling off his cloak and hanging it by the window. The empty sleeve of his work robe, tied in a limp knot at the shoulder, flapped lamely as he sat down.

Dan unstacked each tier of the food box and set it on the desk. He arranged the dishes of dipping sauce and handed Caide a pair of chopsticks. Hands shaking from hunger and anticipation, he picked up a dumpling, dipped it in sauce, and ate it whole. A heavenly blend of ground pork and savory juices swirled in his mouth as he chewed. “Mmh,” he moaned. “That hit the spot.”

Caide chewed quietly, hunched over with a sullen expression. He’d been sulking like this ever since that fiery debacle at the docks. Dull-eyed and just going through the motions, like a leaf floating aimlessly downstream. None of it was his fault, of course, but maybe that only made it worse. It must’ve been especially tragic since he took the chance, paid the cost, but lost the prize anyway.

“I assume the meeting went well?” Dan asked. He had to keep prodding. Caide had been in a similar state when they first met, down on himself for losing an arm. A year passed before he’d come to be more than just a blank-faced shell of a man. These things took time. Unfortunately for them, time was a luxury they didn’t have right now.

“Yes,” Caide said. “The man just handed me the envelope and left.” He paused. “I think he’s a prison guard.”

“The warden of [Prison name], actually. How did you know?”

Caide reached for another dumpling, drew it close to his face and inspected it–turning it over at the end of his chopsticks. Seemingly satisfied, he ate the whole thing in one bite.

Dan winced and shifted in his seat. No dipping sauce? Heresy. His friend appeared to be in a worse frame of mind than he imagined, eating dumplings undipped like that.

“He looked shifty to me,” Caide said. “Like he couldn’t get away fast enough. So I tailed him. Ended up at [Prison name].” He picked a speck of dust from his work robes. “The rest was guesswork.”

“So you’re telling me,” Dan said, “that you stalked him across half the city? And he didn’t even notice?” A useful skill, to be sure. “I didn’t know you could do that...”

Caide’s head snapped up and worry flashed on his face–the look of someone who’d said too much. He waved it off. “It’s nothing special,” he said “Not particularly sharp, that warden of yours. Anyone could’ve followed him around.”

*Of course.* But Dan let it pass–no use prying about it right now. “Could’ve just asked me about it and saved yourself the trouble,” he said.

“Doesn’t matter,” said Caide. “Shouldn’t be poking my nose into your business, anyway.”

“Well, that’s actually what I wanted to talk about.”

Caide raised an eyebrow.

“As it turns out, I’m going to need you to be completely involved in my business.”

“What does that even mean?” Caide said. He frowned and narrowed his eyes at Dan. “You’re planning something, aren’t you?”

Something stupid, probably. There wasn’t even much of a plan to begin with. [Elaborate on plan more]

“I’m going to fight the summer fires,” Dan said. “And I’ll need you to lead the charge.”

Caide stared, likely waiting for Dan to crack his usual smile and admit it was all a joke. “You’re serious,” he said with a hint of disappointment. Like expecting anything of him proved too much. “Lead the charge? You know what I am, Dan. The only thing I’d be charging into is a pitiful, fiery death.”

Life already had Caide lying curled in a ball of his own mistakes, but then decided to give him one last kick in the gut for good measure. Sometimes it came to a point where a man couldn’t take any more. Left alone, he’d likely waste away in a puddle of his own self-pity.

Dan could only imagine himself in Caide’s shoes. What would it take to break his spirit like that? He suspected it wouldn’t take much. He’d been nearly brought to tears over a box of dumplings, after all.

“You’re right,” Dan said. “I know what you are. You’re the kind of man who’d rather die a pitiful death than live a pitiful life.”

Silence stretched out before them as Caide stared into nothing, the shadows on his face flickering by candlelight. Maybe it was too much to ask from a man who lost the fire in his eyes.

“Why me? I’m sure there are plenty out there that could help. ” 

“I need someone I could trust.”

Caide looked up, and in his dark eyes Dan glimpsed a pinprick of light that had nothing to do with the nearby candles. Not a roaring blaze, perhaps. Just a little ember of hope. A spark of renewed purpose.

There it is.

Caide gave a curt nod. “How can I help?”

Suddenly, his headache didn’t seem so bad. Hardly even hurt now.

“The one who demanded your betrayal–the hooded man,” Dan said.

“I need you to find him for me.”
