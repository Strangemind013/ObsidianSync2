[Dan and Caide walking in the forest. Dan is chatty, while Caide is on edge. Caide is worried about bandits since it’s almost sunset.]

[They talk about Caide’s arm as they walk. Caide is in a rush and getting antsy since it’s getting dark. He tells Dan that bandits might be about. Dan starts counting the steps.]

[Just as Dan is about to pass out, they see the clearing and the end of the path. Describe the setpiece here.]

[They arrive late to the event. Lots of important, powerful people. They run into one Deputy Minister’s wife, who’s friendly with Dan. He thinks about how long he’d “worked”-TK the Lady Diwa. He thought she would help in persuading her husband, the Deputy Minister, but alas, she proved ineffectual. Still, her favor wouldn’t hurt, and he’d thought of other ways to make use of her. They exchange shallow pleasantries. Dan mentions a Garden-TK which their young son might enjoy, and asks Caide to accompany the young master. “This man is my personal guard, Lady Diwa. Your son will be the safest person here. As they leave, Dan mutters to Caide to keep the boy in there until the fireworks begin, to which he is to bring the boy to the main hall at once. Caide looked puzzled, but otherwise nodded.]

[Dan finds Deputy Minister Diwa at the courtyard where the important and self-important attendees of the festivities-TK all gathered. The Cardinal makes a small speech. Dan laments how Diwa must see himself as a waste of potential, clinging to his honor as his last hope of a significant life. Dan approaches the Deputy Minister and has a conversation in hushed tones. ]

[Dan tries to be pleasant, but Diwa displays outright hostility towards him, displeased that someone of low status even dares to speak to him, let alone ask him favors. Dan deflects this hostility by gossiping about a wealthy merchant’s new wife. A former courtesan from Snowdrop Garden. Diwa scoffs and rejects the shameful-TK pairing.]

[Dan helped this merchant acquire his wife from the Snowdrop Garden in exchange for agreeing to part with seven of his storehouses. He explains this to Minister Diwa. He asks what this has to do with him, expressing disinterest by neither the lowly merchant’s dealings, nor his shameful activities.]

[Dan tells him that Diwa will buy said storehouses for him. Dan will provide the money and be the de facto owner, with Diwa simply acting as the owner on paper. With a substantial “talent fee” for Diwa, of course. Being a man of honor, Diwa rejects this proposition. *Men of honor are the most annoying-TK to deal with. Not only are they wrong, but they can be so smug about it.* ]

[Diwa hisses at him and condemns his proposal. “I don’t know what game you think you’re playing, but you overreach, steward. You’re not half as clever as you delude yourself into believing. I am a veteran of the King’s court, and you dare command me? You are nothing–a child stumbling amongst tigers and snakes.” He jerked his head at The Cardinal, who was currently swarmed by flatterers and sycophants. “Run home to your father before you get chewed to death.” ]

[“There is no need for all these threats, Deputy Minister. I simply wished to gossip about wives. But if you insist… Allow me one of my own. Three hundred and fifty-seven paces from the front gate, a pack of bandits lies hidden in a freshly-dug trench by the roadside. They look to the night sky, waiting for a signal. Something bright. Something loud. Something they couldn’t possibly miss.”]

[A firecracker lights up the sky.]

[“Can you guess what the signal is for?”]

[Diwa scoffs at the bare threat, and brags about his retinue of armed guards.]

[“Indeed. I saw them outside by your carriage, fully armored, spears at the ready. Admittedly, they *are* intimidating. A force to be reckoned with, as you say. The thing is,” Dan said, raising a hand. Caide stepped forth from the other end of the courtyard with the Diwa boy in tow. “Will they arrive in time?”

[Deputy Minister Diwa was taken aback, but quickly composed himself into a withering glare.  “This is the sort of uncouth wit that warrants a knife in the throat, young master. I suggest you tread carefully. ” Diwa smiled, but the smallest eye-twitch betrayed him.]

[“My apologies.” Dan placed a hand to his chest and bowed. “I was out of line. My… *upbringing* betrays me.”]




[Caide approached him with an annoyed-TK look. “I suspect I’ve been used to further one of your plans again.”-TK. “You accompanied a child and his mother in a garden. Tell me, did they enjoy themselves?” “The boy was particularly amused by the ducks.” “As he should. Those ducks live better lives than most people.”]
