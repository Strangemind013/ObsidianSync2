Sweet-tooth never had any doubt that his father would send for him. A month too late, perhaps, but still very welcome. *Minister Sung* had always been stubborn like that. Ever-devoted to his honor, even if it meant sending his only son to prison. Sweet-tooth didn’t dare complain, though. Anything was better than being stuck in this shithole. Heh. *Shithole.* A new word he’d learned shortly after he arrived. The inmates at Sadampo prison had immeasurably contributed to the expansion of his vocabulary. Swearwords, mostly.

They came in the dead of night, scaring Sweet-tooth stiff as he awoke to grabbing hands. His lack of any significant resistance wasn’t out of cowardice, of course. They just took him by surprise. Still, he whimpered and moaned as they put a bag over his head, gagged him, tied his hands and feet, and dragged him a considerable distance away from his cell. He heard soft grunts as he was heaved into a cart among other wriggling bodies.

*Strange*, Sweet-tooth thought. Who else would’ve been worth rescuing besides him? All part of the plan, he supposed. Maybe it would make for less suspicion if he was mixed in among other escapees. A tad irresponsible perhaps, letting a few other criminals walk free just so he could go back to his life of debauchery. The guilt didn’t last long, however–smothered by an ever-present longing for the pleasures that a month’s imprisonment had been denying him. He could already feel the warm rush of wine in his throat. He could already taste the women. A thick, heavy sheet rustled as it was laid over them for cover. Reins cracked, horses whinnied, and the cart started forward.

The horse-drawn cart travelled for what he thought were ages, hooves clip-clopping with each trot. He could’ve sworn there was another cart following them. Hard to tell in his state, bound and gagged and lying facedown, spit pooling at his cheek. He did his best to relax–he might’ve fallen asleep if it wasn’t for his head knocking on the cart’s deck at every bump in the road. After a long, rough while and a sore forehead, the cart finally skidded to a halt. Wooden panels creaked, and Sweet-tooth heard the muffled stomps of men disembarking.

The rest of the prisoners around him yelled themselves hoarse into their gags. How foolish of them. The least these ingrates could do was shut up and stay still. Something moved nearby, which brought on more muffled yelling. The unmistakable sharp whine of an unsheathing knife immediately shut them up though. After a few moments of scuffling, a panicked voice stammered. “What are you–”

“Stand over there,” another voice said calmly. 

After a some time, they got to Sweet-tooth. Rough hands grabbed him by the shoulders and sat him upright, feet dangling off the edge of the cart bed. The bag on his head slid off and he squinted at the blinding torchlight, eyes watering. Wrists still bound, he pulled off his gag awkwardly and breathed in a lungful of cool, night air. 

A burly, tan-skinned man with a friendly face came into view. He had a knife out but didn’t use it, instead choosing to untie Sweet-tooth’s wrist with deft fingers. 

“Couldn’t you just cut it?” Sweet-tooth asked impatiently.

“Waste of a good rope.”

Sweet-tooth flexed his wrists and shoulders this way and that, muscles sore from being bound so tight. “Took you long enough,” he said. “Now, I’m not privy to what goes into breaking a man out of prison, but–”

“Quiet,” the burly man said, to which Sweet-tooth obliged immediately. Nothing cowardly about that, of course. Hardly any point in arguing against a man with a knife–and so close to his throat, at that. 

The burly man nudged him off the cart after freeing his ankles. “Fall in line,” he said, jerking a thumb to the side.

Sweet-tooth’s bare feet hit damp, grassy earth. They seemed to be in a forest clearing somewhere. Darkness closed in all around them, barely fended off by a pair of cart lanterns and a some torches. A few paces away stood six of his fellow prisoners lined up in a row, their familiar yet unfriendly faces waiting on him. *What’s this?* he thought. The smallest seed of fear and doubt blossomed in his chest. Father *did* send for him... didn’t he? Nevertheless, he decided he’d cooperate, so he kept quiet and joined the file. 

A rotund man in fine robes a size too small leaned against one of the carts, perusing the line of prisoners appraisingly like a horse trader would the latest stock. He seemed pleased, nodding to himself with the easy confidence of a man with no worries. Behind him loomed a tall, tense-looking fellow in a faded-black cloak, the hilt of a sword poking up from his back. His watchful eyes darted at every slight movement in the row of prisoners. Off to the other cart was the burly man from earlier, gathering and coiling rope. Another fellow with the same tan skin and rough features tended to the horses. They even appeared to share a preference for knives, judging by the daggers at his waist. Must’ve been the burly man’s brother. Or cousin, at the least. 

*That’s four against seven,* Sweet-tooth thought. Granted, they had weapons, but still... 

The well-fed man in sweat-stained robes stepped forward and bowed at them, smiling enthusiastically. “Good evening, gentlemen,” Tight-robe said. He was met with a lengthy silence, but it didn’t dampen his cheer at the least. “I am Dan, and I’m here to offer you a job. It’s not a pleasant one, as you might’ve guessed. Otherwise I wouldn’t have bothered with breaking you out.”

“Will there be pay?” asked Pao–a snot-nosed, boyish fellow. Not particularly bright, this one–he’d assumed the role of errand boy in Sadampo as a way to survive. Pity, as it would appear that his fate of being ordered around wasn’t ever destined to change.

Dan shook his head. “No. Not in coin. The gods know I haven’t enough to go around, no... But by the end of the summer, I will hand anyone still with us a signed pardon from the King. If you’re interested, kindly proceed to this cart.” He motioned to one of the two carts that brought them. “If not, that other one will take you back to Sadampo before sunrise.”

A hush of excited murmuring, along with some raised eyebrows, befell the row of prisoners.

As the Minister of Order’s only son, Sweet-tooth hadn’t worked a day in his life. Looking back, perhaps now would be as good a time as any to change his ways. To redeem himself. To man up and earn his freedom by the sweat of his brow and the strength of his–

*Wait. Could it be...?*

Didn’t it seem all too convenient? He wouldn’t put it past his father to set up an elaborate plan like this, designed to get him on *the right path*, as it were. A desperate, last-ditch effort to squeeze an honorable son out of him. And to think he almost fell for it. *Not today, Father. Not today.*

“What’s the job?” asked Pung–a huge, lumbering, boulder of a man. The inmates of Sadampo were fortunate that he didn’t have a taste for violence, otherwise they would’ve all been at his mercy.

“We’re going to fight the summer fires.”

*Ooh, that ought to ruffle some feathers.* No one had ever tried to defy the will of the Summer God before. At least, no one ever had to. The monks at Mount Bulusan never did shut up about it–they’d gladly talk a man’s ear off if you let them. *Who are we, ignorant mortals, to interfere with the Summer God’s hand? The fire is his will–to hinder it is heresy.* Hardly worth the risk to one’s soul, Sweet-tooth reckoned. Besides, the summer fires were a small inconvenience. A passing annoyance. It was mostly the peasants that had to worry about it, them and their effortlessly flammable homes. 

“Are you fucking with us?” Crow asked, rubbing the dark circles under his eyes and stifling a yawn. Poor bastard’s been plagued with nightmares, mostly ending with him screaming himself awake, and everyone else besides. Hence the name. Crow–the one who squawks at night.

“I wish I was, my good man,” Dan said. “But the city’s been under siege, so to speak. Half the fields burned down before harvest, and I don’t know about you, but I’m not eating ash for lunch. Now, I know what you’re thinking--unfortunately, maintaining supply lines had been difficult at best. The trade routes inland are plagued by banditry, and someone’s been setting fire to merchant ships that grace our port.” He sighed as he put his hands on his hips. “Simply put, we’re backed into a corner. It gets any worse and the city will eat itself.”

Crow raised an eyebrow. “All because of some fires?”

“Some fires? Have you been–” Dan pinched the bridge of his nose. “Ah, right. My apologies.” He made that end-of-his-patience smile usually reserved for irredeemably stupid children. “See, these aren’t like the fires you’ve known. At least, not as frequent as this. Or as destructive. Every other day something goes up in smoke. It seems we’ve angered the Summer God... or someone else entirely. Nonetheless, I refuse to stand by and do nothing. And if the Summer God objects... Well, he can show up and stop us himself.”

Lon, a gaunt man with thinning hair frowned, as usual. Never a good day with this one. “Is it *us* already?”

“Not yet,” Dan said. “But I’m optimistic. Don’t have much of a choice, do I? Right now I need men. Men who are committed. Men who follow orders. Men who will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.” He looked each of them in the eye. “Are you those men?”

Sweet-tooth looked down on his untrimmed toenails, shifting uneasily. He could lie to himself all he wanted, but he definitely wasn’t one of those men. Even a task as menial as shoveling horse-shit would be out of his depth, let alone something like this. 

“Why us?” asked Batch, a sneering bastard with a talent for pissing people off. 

“Because,” Dan said, “I believe you are innocent. As far as I could tell, at least. I’ve looked into each of your cases, and then some. All I saw was poor circumstance, bad timing. Maybe someone’s out to get you, or needed someone to blame. Either way, your guilt was decided... rather unfairly, I think.”

*Was it, though?* Sweet-tooth *had* been neck-deep in gambling debts. There was no denying it. What was unfair, however, was that his father refused to do anything. He just stood by as they dragged his son away. Where was the honor in that?

Pung scratched his chin with a puzzled look. “I’m sorry, Young Master, but I *am* guilty.”

“Yes,” Dan chuckled. He had to crane his nonexistent neck and look up at Pung to even meet his eye. “But I’m willing to overlook a little tax fraud for a man of your physical gifts. Look at you. You look like you could uproot a tree with your bare hands.”

Pung nodded thoughtfully. “I see...”

Sweet-tooth should probably say something as well, but decided against it. What would admitting his guilt even accomplish? Besides, he wasn’t–

“You foolishly removed our bonds,” Batch said, an arrogant grin on his smug face. “Why shouldn’t we just gang up on you and fuck off? I bet Pung here could take all of you on by himself.” 

Sweet-tooth let out a sigh. Of all the inmates to bring, why him? Had he really been innocent? Looking back, half the brawls he’d witnessed at Sadampo were caused by whatever came out of this bastard’s mouth.

Dan shrugged. “Sure. It’s worth a try. But that line of thinking, Ba-chen, son of Ba-tan, already cost you six years of your life. I suggest not throwing away the rest of it.”

Batch scowled and looked like he might lunge at the fat man, but something stirred in the shadows. Cloakey stepped forward, the hand not hidden by his cloak reaching for his sword. They glared at each other for a moment, but otherwise relaxed when Batch shrugged and held up his hands. “Whatever you say, boss.”

“As it so happens,” Dan continued. “I am fond of giving second chances. Here’s yours. It would be wise of you to take it.”

Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. What did stopping the summer fires even mean, anyway? Chucking bucketsful of water at a burning house? Pretty sure he could manage that. He’d worry about his soul later. Besides, there had to be some way he could weasel himself out of this down the line. He certainly had the experience–he’d been dodging obligations all his life.

Duck, a quiet, elderly man who mostly kept to himself, shuffled over to Dan. His gray hair gleamed in the torchlight as he reached out a shaky, gnarled hand. “You better keep your word.”

Dan smiled. “Before this is done,” he said as he shook the hand vigorously, “maybe that’s all I’ll have left.”

As Duck climbed the cart, the rest of them stepped in line to take the deal. Each shook Dan’s hand with a word or a warning or threat of their own. 

Finally, Sweet-tooth’s turn came. If he bolted off into the night, he doubted anyone would give chase. Would they risk leaving six prisoners unattended just to search for his skinny behind? He was hardly worth the sweat. His feet dug on the soft earth, ready to sprint at a moment’s notice. He took a deep breath. He took another. Fuck it.

*Well, here’s to honor.* 

He strolled forward, beaming wide, and reached out for a handshake. 

Dan frowned down on his outstretched hand as though he was offered a dead fish. He waved him off. “Ah, no. Not you,” he said. “To the other cart, if you please. Your mother awaits.”

"Oh. I guess Father really did–"

Crow yawned widely, not even bothering to cover his mouth. Mannerless, as always. “So, where are we headed?”

"To get yourselves cleaned up," said Dan. "I’ve reserved Snowdrop Garden for the evening, and not at a small cost. So enjoy yourselves. Wash off the stink of prison. Have a nice, hot meal. Get drunk. I’ve also hired some women to... *assist.*" 

That last bit was met with much cheering and whooping. What Sweet-tooth would have given to climb aboard and join them... He could only gaze mournfully, sitting by himself on the other cart. The boring one, destined for home and further away from worldly pleasures. He supposed he shouldn’t complain. Freedom had been handed to him after all. That being said, it would’ve been nice to earn said freedom and feel righteous about himself. Maybe that was why people get obsessed with all this *honor* nonsense. 

“Oh and one more thing,” Dan called out. “I don’t need to remind you to behave yourselves, I assume? But just in case, I will anyway.” He gestured to Cloakey. “This fellow here is Caide. Remember his face. Any one of you does something particularly distasteful–he’s the one you’ll have to deal with. See that sword? He hasn’t drawn that thing in quite a while, and proud of the fact. Trying to be a better man, he says. Should you force him to... Well, you know how it goes.” He looked around at everyone on the fun cart. "To those who’d think of running–wherever you might think you’re safe, he’ll track you down in... I don’t know, five days?"

Caide, who hadn’t said a word all night, shrugged. 

“Three.”


#

The boring cart trundled along the roughly-paved road, rocking this way and that. It had been an improvement, to be fair–at least Sweet-tooth was upright this time. The creaking of wheels and chirping of crickets filled the night air, along with the occasional flapping of Caide’s cloak.

“What took you so long?” Sweet-tooth asked. “I was in there for a month. If you think my father will pay you well for a job this late, you’ve got–”

“The Minister reached out to me but a few days ago.” Dan said, not even bothering to look back. “Honestly, I didn’t think he’d even send for you. I wonder what changed his mind...”

“I’m his heir, you cretin,” Sweet-tooth spat with all the venom he could muster. “Have a mind with whom you speak.” He had no quarrel with Dan, of course. But given the circumstances, he was left with no choice–he had to put him in his place. 

*You allow them to disrespect you once, and soon enough you end up at their mercy.* 

Dan chuckled as he tugged at the reins. “Of course, your heir-ness. My apologies.”

The cart passed through the gates of their all-too-familiar estate. Meticulously pruned guava trees, immaculate hedges, and grass so rigorously maintained that it might as well just give up on growing. He could just make out the pinpricks of lamplight from the patrolling guards.

He had been well-acquainted with these grounds, having snuck out more times than he was proud of, and stumbling back drunk in the morning. His arrival then would be met by his father’s flared nostrils and a prepared sermon about the things expected of a minister’s son. He’d even tried beating him sober a few years back. Had a cane and all. Perhaps an attempt to beat something more than drinking out of him–the gods know how that old man formed his ideas. He soon gave up, of course. The bruises did nothing but start even more rumors. 

The captain of the household guard–whose name he couldn’t quite remember–awaited them in front of the manor. Two of his lantern-bearing men stood behind him at attention. The cart was still rolling to a stop when Sweet-tooth hopped off, kicking up dirt as he landed. Dan hauled himself grunting from the cart, and approached the captain and his men with Caide right behind him like a looming shadow.

"Young master," said the captain, hand on his chest in a small bow.

"Hey, you..." Sweet-tooth said. What was his name again?

"Your mother has been worried sick," the captain said, gesturing them inside. "Please. She has waited long enough."

They found Father in his study, as usual, half-lit by a single candle at his writing desk. Even in his plain sleeping robes, he exuded a sense of regality that only the proper lineage could bestow. His square jaw bore a graying, closely-trimmed beard, and his intense eyes could’ve burned through the calligraphy paper he stared at so intently. He’d just finished a brushstroke when the captain cleared his throat. 

“Your son has arrived, Master Sung.”

With one hand holding his sleeve in place at the elbow, Father gently rolled the tip of his brush against the inkstone and squeezed out every last inkdrop. After a while, he set the brush down with all the care of one handling a sword. 

*He’s getting old,* Sweet-tooth thought. The candlelight pushed the lines of Father’s face into sharp relief, the deepest creases carved around his mouth. Shouldn’t have been that bad–if only he didn’t frown all the time, especially around his son. But alas, like calligraphy, frowning had been one of his many hobbies.

Father readjusted his sleeve and smoothed the front of his robes. Without taking his eyes off his work, he wordlessly gestured them in, all the while scrutinizing the drying ink of his just-finished calligraphy with furrowed brows. 

Didn’t even spare them a look. Typical. A cold knot of dread twisted in Sweet-tooth’s gut as he stepped through the threshold of Father’s study. For a moment he was a child again, trembling where he stood–he’d made a mistake, and *Father knows.*

“Thank you, Edil. You may leave us.”

*Edil!* Of course. An utterly unremarkable name, one that Sweet-tooth could hardly be blamed for forgetting.

Captain Edil lit one of the tall candlesticks by the wall, bathing the shadowed part of the room in a dull orange light. He took a bow, backed away, and smoothly slid the door shut with a soft click.

Sweet-tooth approached his father as close as he would dare, relieved that the writing desk came between them. He bowed at the waist, folded his legs, and sat straight-backed with hands palm-down on his lap. Father would have no chance to berate his posture today–that much Sweet-tooth could do, at least.

For the first time in a month, Father looked at him. He studied Sweet-tooth with a passive face, not even with half the interest he’d shown for his calligraphy. “For your eighth name-day,” he said, “I brought you hunting. What game did you shoot down with your bow?”

“Nothing,” said Sweet-tooth. What was he playing at? They both knew he was a terrible shot. That day, Minister Sung’s only son came home and tearfully rushed to his mother for comfort. “I missed every shot I took until sundown. My quiver ran dry, and by that point you decided to head back.” For his eighth name-day, he’d been gifted humiliation. 

“After your uncle’s funeral, we were left alone at his grave. What did I tell you then?”

Uncle had been a jovial man, and one of the few that was always kind to him. Unfortunately, he’d made the mistake of getting tangled up with Lacanian insurrectionists. Or at least, was accused of it. Father’s judgment had been swift, decisive, and most of all, final. It rained that day, as though the heavens grieved with him. “You allow them to disrespect you once, and soon enough you end up at their mercy.”

Father nodded a single, miniscule nod. What was that for, anyway? Did it satisfy him to reminisce about past agonies? “You look most unlike yourself,” he said. “Let us hope your mother recognizes you.”

*Right,* Sweet-tooth thought, palming his scratchy jaw. He’d grown quite a beard, and a month in Sadampo must’ve morphed him into a stranger. Not that they were overly familiar to begin with, but still, the questioning made sense. Too bad they had no happy memories to draw from. He started to get up, but Father raised a hand.

“Before you go to her,” he said, “I will need your decision.”

*On what? Nothing’s ever simple with him, is it?* Couldn’t even go to his sick mother without a catch.

“I will not harbor an escaped criminal in this house,” Father said. He couldn’t completely hide the contempt in his voice, but Sweet-tooth appreciated the effort. “You either go with Dan, do whatever it is he requires, and earn yourself a pardon.”

Now that he thought about it, that plan didn’t sound quite as appealing as it did. A heat-of-the-moment decision on his part. Too much work, honestly.

“Or?”

“Or,” Father said, “you sail away to Silan, where you could live out your days guzzling wine in loose-collared company–as you so insist on doing. I will bequeath you your inheritance. Enough gold for one pitiful lifetime, if you vow to never return. I refuse to watch you dishonor our family name any further.”

Sweet-tooth had never been to Silan before, but he’d heard good things. A land of refined culture, home to the most inspired artists and musicians. A place where talent is celebrated and nourished, not debased for the consumption of the ignorant masses like they did here. Maybe there he’d be more welcome, and without the hateful gaze of Minister Sung. It sounded like a dream. Surely, wine and women were the same anywhere, were they not?

“Must I decide now? Can’t this wait until I see Mother?”

Father pressed his lips into that end-of-his-patience frown reserved exclusively for his son. “Fine,” he said as he stood up. “Come.”

As they approached Mother’s room, the soft musical tinkling of her prized music-box greeted them. A wonderous curiosity, gifted to her by a local tinkerer. It had always helped her sleep. Father led the way and gently, quietly slid the door open. In the sparse futility of her room lay Mother, a blanket up to her chest, the ornate music box beside her persisting with its whimsical tune.

Sweet-tooth drew in a sharp breath. *She’s sicker than I thought.* Both mother and son would’ve had trouble recognizing each other. Her skin, once alive with color, was now waxy and pale. A tinge of gray, even. Her hair, once shiny and lustrous, was now dull and rough and thinning. Her lips cracked, her cheeks gaunt, her fingers brittle, crooked sticks. She lay there, unmoving, as they approached. 

Father sat a few paces from her, just out of reach. Perhaps he feared that a simple nudge might crumble his beloved wife. Sweet-tooth feared the same, yet he dared himself closer. He took the woman’s gnarled tree-branch of a hand and folded it in his own. “It’s me, Mother… I’m here.”

Silence. She didn’t even stir.

A bitter cold rushed from where Sweet-tooth’s skin touched his mother’s. It seeped into his bones, drove the breath out of him, and insisted on settling in the pit of his stomach. “Father,” he said as he laid Mother’s hand down. “I think she’s…”

Father shoved him aside as he knelt before his wife. “Sani…” 

Sweet-tooth recoiled at the sorrow in his father’s plea. It felt as though he was an intruder, an unwelcome eavesdropper on an intimate, drawn-out goodbye between the two of them. This rare show of humanity, however, lasted but a moment.

His father composed himself, regained his posture, and smoothed the front of his robes. He reached for Mother’s music box and shut its lid, the music cut short with the snap. They sat there for a moment in the sickening silence. “She made me promise to bring you home,” Father said. “She wanted to say goodbye. I couldn’t even give her that.”

Sweet-tooth bit down on his lip to the point of bleeding. He wouldn’t let himself cry. Not like this. Not where he could see. He could weep for his mother later, when he was alone. “I’m leaving,” he said with a wavering croak. “Send me to Silan, Father. There’s nothing for me here.”

Father turned back and glared at him–years of disappointment, shame, and loathing distilled into a look of pure hatred. He grabbed the music box in a white-knuckled grip, the wooden panels straining against his crushing fist.

In that moment, Sweet-tooth understood. There wasn’t anything he could’ve done–Father had given up on him long ago. If not for Mother, he would’ve been disowned and struck from the family register without a second thought. As Father raised his fist above his head, Sweet-tooth simply closed his eyes and resigned himself to his fate. If anything, he might’ve deserved it.

A resounding crack echoed as Father brought the music box crashing down on Sweet-tooth’s skull.

#
A thousand stars winked at Sweet-tooth as he awoke, the vastness of the night sky spreading out before him. He lay on something shaky and his head hurt like a bastard. He groaned. The pain came in waves, throbbing and stinging with every heartbeat. Someone had bandaged his head and placed a bundle of cloth under it as a makeshift pillow. Someone still cared for him, at the least. The familiar creaking and wobbling clued him in–for the third time tonight, he was riding a damned cart.

An unshaven man with unkempt hair came into view and squinted at him.

“He’s awake,” said Caide.

“Oh, joy,” someone sighed. Dan, most likely. “I was hoping we’d get there before he came to.”

The twisted image of Father’s hateful eyes still burned fresh in his mind. “What happens to me now?” Sweet-tooth asked. “Are you going to–” 

“We don’t do that,” said Dan. “The minister simply wanted you off his estate, and I happened to have a cart.”

“Did he say anything… about me?”

Another sigh. “He said he has no son.”

“Of course.”

The first hints of sunrise bled orange from the easternmost sky. Looking back, he supposed it wasn’t too bad. He was out of Sadampo, and had every chance to start his life anew.

“If you’re interested,” Dan said. “I could still use an extra pair of hands.”

A job would be as good a start as any to this new life he wanted for himself. If anything, a pardon would spare him the trouble of looking over his shoulder forever. “Sure,” he said. “Let’s do that.”

“Excellent. Welcome aboard.”

Sweet-tooth didn’t bother getting up. What would be the point? He just wanted to lay there and drift back to sleep. Maybe he’d wake up and everything would be better. But again, he was deluding himself. His mother was dead, and his father disowned him. He had nothing. No one.

“How’s your head?” Caide asked.

The dawnbreak sky swam before him as his eyes welled. “It hurts,” Sweet-tooth croaked, letting the tears fall.
