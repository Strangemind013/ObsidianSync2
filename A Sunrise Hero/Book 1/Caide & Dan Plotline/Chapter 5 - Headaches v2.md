Dan might’ve rubbed his temple down to the bone from all he had to deal with today. One after the other, issues and disputes appeared before him, expecting him to provide a solution. A never-ending series of headaches. Some minister’s son hadn’t come home for a month, sisters quarreling over inheritance, and a desperate man seeking to prove his wife’s adultery. All favors asked of the Cardinal–supposed champion of the poor and helper of the needy. A friend to all.

If only they knew.

A knock on the door from Daril cut his musings short. Another one? The sunlight filtering in from the window had been turning to that almost-dinner shade of orange. This better be quick. He’d been here all day, and his stomach was complaining. “Come in.” 

At the door beside Daril stood a woman who, known only to a select few, was well into her fifties. She simply refused to look the part. Impeccably composed and swathed in layers upon layers of the choicest painted silk that would make any textile merchant blush. One could be forgiven in mistaking her for divinity, with pale yet richly-blushed skin, crimson lips, and heavy-lidded eyes. Ornate pins pulled back her dark hair in the signature butterfly hairdo of high-ranking courtesans. She glided the dusty stone floor, stood in front of Dan, and bowed gracefully at the waist, painfully out of place in the tavern’s pantry-turned-study. Like a lotus flower in a latrine.

Dan arrived at the conclusion that Lady Tahede must have been a woman of breathtaking beauty in her youth. A few decades ago perhaps–her skin not as supple, not as smooth, but still flawless. It didn’t take much to imagine her as the shining jewel of Snowdrop Garden in her day, adored by those who could afford even a glimpse. How fortunate for him, then, that she’d honored him with her presence. She wanted something, of course, but still.

“You must forgive the state of this place, my lady,” Dan said. The pantry, which was hastily converted into a makeshift study, was strewn with boxes and stacks of ledgers. “I’ve been recently asked to… *relocate,* and I’m afraid you’ve caught me at an inopportune time. Please, sit.” He nodded to Daril, which promptly procured from one of the cabinets a cushion for Lady Tahede to sit on.

Lady Tahede gave Daril a small bow before gracefully folding her legs under her, not a hair out of place nor a wrinkle on her robes. 

“We’ll need some refreshments, Daril. If memory serves, I believe the lady would prefer green tea?”

Lady Tahede tucked a lock of hair behind her ear as she gently inclined her head, giving a generous glimpse of her smooth, pale neck. Dan caught a whiff of lily nectar perfume as the soft tinkling of bells on her hairpins chimed with her every move. 

Daril gave a small bow, backed away, and closed the door softly behind him.

“My dear lady,” Dan said, hand on his chest in a small bow, “to what do I owe this honor?”

[Dan shows insecurity with the state of his study,  and assures the lady that this is all temporary.  He firmly believes that once he clears his name, and does what the cardinal wants, he’ll be welcomed back to Redhallow]

[Lady Tahede butters Dan up, showering him with praise and saying that Redhallow would fall apart without him, if it hasn’t already. Dan admits to himself that its true, but tells himself that it was a mutual thing–that he’d be nothing if not for the Cardinal. ]

“Well,” Dan said, “I must say that I am sufficiently flattered, my lady. Well enough that we can carry on and proceed with your true purpose. So I ask again–to what do I owe this honor?”

[Lady Tahede tells Dan about Meita and her retirement dilemma. Lady Tahede has a utilitarian approach to her personnel, and simply wants to get the most mileage out of her prized flower. She laments that it would be easier if there was a specific reason that she could act on, but there isn’t. She couldn’t force her to stay because her emotional state is directly related to the quality of her work, and that is something she couldn’t compromise.]

[Dan thinks that the Lady is being outsmarted by Meita, which he admires more than her looks. He tells Lady Tahede that if she doesn’t let Meita retire now, she’d probably end up replacing her, and sooner rather than later.]

“It would bring me no greater joy than for her to become the next Lady of Snowdrop Garden. A pity that only my death would allow that to happen…”

[Dan says that not only is the task challenging in itself, but it would also be a costly endeavor. There’s also the matter of payment. They haggle in their own subtle way. Dan praises Lady Tahede and calls her a formidable woman. But he also points out that in the years that they’ve known each other, there were only a few times that she asked him for help. He says that he knows that she hates the fact that she needed  help, and that she hated that it’s him she has to ask for help even more. Regardless of how calm she might appear, she wouldn’t be here if she wasn’t truly desperate and has exhausted all her options. In the end, the Lady has no choice but to relent.]

[Dan asks for three things: Money to hire help, information regarding Sadin Abaya, and a night in the Garden for seven men.]

[While waiting for Caide, Dan talks to Seyla. He hesitates as he’s about to relay bad news, in which he needs her to move out of the tavern asap. 

[Seyla doesn’t believe it first, thinking that Dan was getting back at her for some prank she did.]

[Dan explains to her what’s up, but vaguely. He tells her that he plans to close down the tavern and use the building for another purpose. This purpose requires strangers to move in, so it wouldn’t be very safe for her to stay in the tavern.

[Seyla argues her point
