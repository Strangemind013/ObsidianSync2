Goals: 
- Meita's ruse
- Abduct Sadin Abaya and interrogate him
- Dan and Caide discuss his methods

- Inciting Incident: They kidnap Sadin Abaya
- OOD: To convince people to do what he wants without having to cause them real harm (I want Meita to forget retirement without threatening her outright / I want to intimidate Sayin Abaya without having to actually hurt him)
- Progressive Complication: Abaya being uncooperative and calling Dan out for his past activities
- Progressive Complication: Caide stepping in 
- Crisis: Does he compromise Caide's morals to keep his own intact?
- Climax: He lets Caide take over
- Resolution: Caide is successful, but by using a bluff
