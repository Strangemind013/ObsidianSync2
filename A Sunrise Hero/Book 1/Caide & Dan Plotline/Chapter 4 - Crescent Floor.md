Caide dusted his shoes on the stone walkway for fear of another reprimand. Same with his cloak, and his trousers, and his hair. He needed to be spotless if he was to finally enter that door.

Hal’s home was a quaint, three-bedroom affair in the Inner district, built on a decently-sized plot of land. Caide wasn’t one to envy, but he would’ve bent over backwards to live in a house like this. To plant medicinal herbs in a sprawling garden, tinker in a workshop, and not worry about anything else. People who lived in houses like this wouldn’t have to betray their friends for money.

Her workshop, meticulously constructed, might’ve been considered an eyesore. A brutally-shaped attachment to the main hall that jutted outwards and up, a glaring contrast to the traditional woodwork architecture. A miniature fortress. Just a huge box of iron and stone, really, with slits at the sides for airflow. Her workshop was perhaps more secure than a noble’s mansion. Maybe even the King’s. Even he, who’d known Hal for years now, was only just allowed to enter. Provided that he dusted himself off first.

He wasn’t even a few steps into the main hall when a bundle of cloth ran in his direction. It stopped short of crashing into him, skidding to a halt on the floor of polished wood.

“Hey Caide!” it said, “Guess who I am.”

“Someone stuck in a sheet?”

Miero, breathless, fidgeted at what must’ve been a blanket draped around his body. It bunched up around his neck, with the ends hanging loose at one side. “No, no! Guess!” the boy of eight chirped, brandishing a wooden sword at Caide. “Oh, wait...” He stuck the toy sword in a fold of blanket at his back and put his fists to his hips in a proud, beaming pose. “Now you can guess!”

“Hmm,” Caide said, wrinkling his nose. “This one’s tricky...”

Miero giggled in his sheet. “I’m you!” he squealed, unable to contain himself. He drew his toy sword and slashed the air, hopping around, fighting unseen enemies.

An honest depiction, Caide thought, if not one arm too many. But in a few days, it shouldn’t matter. “Your grandmother here?”

“She’s inside,” Miero frowned. “Just here to see her again?”

“Well, yeah,” Caide said. “If you don’t find me my own sword, that is. You know what? A nice, long stick should do.” He jerked his head at Miero’s wooden sword. “After we talk, I’ll see how good you are with that thing.”

Miero beamed, took a quick bow, and scurried off outside. “I’ll be back!” he called out behind him. The boy ran off to the bushes, scanned the ground, and grabbed at branches within reach.

Caide knocked on the metal door. Its thick hinges were secured by hefty bolts, and there was no handle or keyhole on its smooth, sheer surface.

“It’s me,” he said.

Something clicked, and a series of clanking and whirring sounds came from inside. The door creaked open a crack.

“Come in quickly, and be careful not to bring the dust with you,” a woman said.

Caide hefted the two-inch thick slab of iron and entered.

The musty, cavernous room had no windows apart from slits in the stone wall high up. A cascading row of round, glass lenses were propped up by metal rods attached to the wall. The highest lens bounced a beam of light from a small opening on the roof to another lens, which then bounced it to another. And another. The light beam zig-zagged between lenses and ended in a glowing glass sphere suspended by thick, metal wires pulled taut. Was it... gathering light? A shutter in the center of the sphere then focused a narrow beam to a small area on Hal’s workbench, where she had been hunched over, chipping away at a piece of ivory with her tools.

All that bother when she could’ve just used a lamp.

“Mind the door,” Hal said. Her graying hair shone in the pillar of light that casted reflections on the magnifying goggles she wore. It made her look like an overgrown bug. She sat on a stool before a large, wooden workbench that had all manner of tools: chisels and blades and sharp, pointed things for carving.

Caide grabbed the handle and heaved the door shut.

Hal absentmindedly raised a fist in his direction and released, palm open. A bag tied to a pulley on the door fell to the ground with a thud, and an assembly of gears and levers clicked and clanked and whirred, putting the locks back in place with a snap.

A bolt of worry flashed in his gut. To use Heraldries so blatantly, like it was nothing. Just to lock a door? What if someone found out? What if–

“Was that Destiny?” Caide asked. Of course he did.

She filed down one side of the piece of ivory with a small wedge of whetstone, sprinkling away white dust with every grinding stroke. “Does it matter?”

There was a time when it was all that mattered. When what she did would have been an exceptional feat. To lift something of that weight, at that distance, without even breaking a sweat... What he would’ve given then, to be as skilled with Heraldries.

“No,” Caide said. “I guess not. Not anymore.”

“And yet you asked.”

Caide shrugged, not sure what to make of it.

“Did you see the cloak we put together?” she said without looking up from her work. “That child has been pestering me all morning,”

“Haven’t had someone impersonate me before.”

“I’ve seen that children tend to mirror the people they respect.”

Respected what, exactly? “Isn’t there anyone better to look up to?” Caide asked. 

“Yes, well...” Hal said. “There’s been a shortage of better people in this city these days. As it stands, he’ll have to make do with you.” She took a pad of sharkskin to the ivory and gently scrubbed its surface. She shot Caide an exasperated look. “Looks like my grandson has found you that stick,” she said. “But not after scouring my garden and muddying the grounds. He waits for you right outside, tapping his feet. He has yet to learn patience, that one,”

Caide looked back at the iron door. At the stone walls. How had she known? A bluff, surely? “How...?” he stammered.

But Hal didn’t explain. With one smooth motion, she scraped off a jagged bump of ivory with her chisel. It was now a smooth, bean-shaped piece. “Be mindful around him, will you? He has no idea of what we are, and I intend for it to remain so.”

“What you are,” Caide corrected her. “I haven’t been a Sage in years.”

“Judgment,” she said.

“What?”

“You asked about the locks.” Once more, she raised a fist at the door, and one of the weights started moving up. Gears spun and clicked. A hefty snap, and the door was unlocked. “I use Judgment to lighten one weight, and a counterweight pulls it up. I release the Heraldry...” She opened her fist, and the weight fell. More clicking and spinning, and the door locked with another snap.

  

Brilliant, Caide thought. Heraldries and tinkering. A simple yet elegant solution, one that only she could use. Even from outside. “That’s... something else,” he said.

“Took me a while to think of that one,” Hal said. “But this...” She took a sharp, pointed carving knife, and ran her fingers along its dull edge. “I stole from someone,” she said with a sly grin. The point of the knife turned a dull purple-black, like it was dipped in shadow. She scribed on one side of the bean-shaped piece of ivory with careful, deliberate strokes. No white dust this time, of course. This blackened blade did not cut. Whatever met its edge simply vanished from existence.

“Careful with that,” Caide said, backing away a step.

“The purest form of Break,” Hal said, “used to line an edge. Or in this case, the point. It’s quite clever, actually. Simple and effective. Its maker had retired, I heard. Shame.”

Caide sighed and shook his head. “Moved on to better things, I hope.”

Halm smiled at him with gentle warmth in her eyes, enlarged by her magnifying goggles. “I hope so too.”

To think she could even use Break like this. Just how powerful was this woman? And how come he’d never heard of her before? Then again, maybe it was for the best.

She dusted off the small piece of ivory and rubbed it with a cloth. “There,” she said. “All done.”

“What’s that supposed to be, anyway?”

“Hmm?” Hal turned the ivory over, inspecting its surface. “This,” she said, “is the tip of your little finger. One last thing I needed to carve.”

“Oh,” said Caide. “Everything’s ready, then?”

“Not everything,” Hal said. “Jade is not so easily acquired, especially with my specifications. That’s two-thirds of the cost right there. Fortunately for you, I know someone, and I’ve been informed that it should arrive tomorrow.”

“Already?” Caide swallowed. “That’s... good.”

Hal raised an eyebrow at him. “A small matter needs attending to, however.”

“Aside from the three thousand marks?” Caide said. “Please, enlighten me.” Another hoop to jump through. Hopefully the last.

“There appears to be some disturbances at the docks, as of late.” She grazed a fine brush on the surface of the ivory fingertip. “My dealer requires your assistance.”

“So I’ve heard,” he said. “Trade ships getting swarmed as they reach port... It’s madness out there. People desperate for food they could afford, or steal, or fight over.” He shook his head. “Merchants now bring their own personal armies just to secure their wares. Could turn ugly anytime.”

“They’ll survive,” Hal said, pulling off her goggles. “They always do. This isn’t anything new, nor the worst they’ve had.”

“Shouldn’t have come to this,” Caide muttered. Still, there wasn’t anything he could do. Not about that, anyway. “So,” he said, “what does this dealer of yours need?”

Hal wrapped the ivory fingertip in a soft cloth and placed it in a wooden box. “Well,” she said, “since you wanted to rush the order, he wasn’t able to make the proper arrangements for a secure shipment.” She took a cloth and started wiping down her tools.

“Meaning?”

“Meaning,” Hal sighed, “that he stashed the jade under a crate of common goods–peaches, to be exact. One that could easily get lost in the clamor.” Hal wiped the last of her instruments, laid them down a metal tray, and met Caide’s eye. “If you want this to proceed, it would be wise for you to secure that crate yourself. It’s the one marked with a smiling cat.” She rinsed her hands in a water basin, scrubbing under every last one of her fingernails. “Go to the docks an hour past midnight. Bring a porter. Bring two. And, most importantly,” she said.

“Bring your sword.”

#####

The [Tavern Name] was near-empty, as usual, when Caide entered at noon. Just Dan in his usual spot, by a round table going over some ledgers, Seyla at the raised platform by the hearth, tuning her harp-zither, and Daril at the counter, wiping down a stack of bowls.

“Looks like business is thriving,” said Caide, looking around at the empty chairs as he took a seat at Dan’s table.

Dan sneered at him. “Don’t start,” he said. He hitched up his round spectacles, dipped his brush in ink, and scribbled something in his ledger. He then rambled on about how he couldn’t quite figure out how this tavern wasn’t getting as much patrons. Something about how he chose a great location in the middle of the city, and how the place was on the way to everywhere important.

Caide mustered up the courage to speak. He had to tell Dan. He owed him that much.

“I don’t expect much,” said Dan, “but I would appreciate it if the place wasn’t so empty, you know?”

“Dan,” said Caide. “Can we talk?”

“What did you think we were doing?”

Caide shot him a deadpan stare. “Alone,” he said. “If you don’t mind.”

“Oh, alright,” Dan said, massaging his thigh. “But I don’t have a mind to get up.” He waved a hand at the counter. “Daril? Would you please escort our talented musician to the kitchens?”

“Sure thing, boss.”

“And have her eat something, will you?” Dan said. “Something warm. Take better care of yourself, Seyla. Look at you. You’re skinnier than that harp-zither.”

“Am I?” Seyla gasped with overacted surprise. “I have been feeling ill these days.” She put a hand on her forehead and swooned, the ribbon of her blindfold swaying. “Must be because of that raise I haven’t been getting.”

Dan scoffed and rolled his eyes. “Get this lunatic out of here, Daril.”

The shopkeeper unfurled a linen blanket, draped it over the counter, and carefully laid down Wanhee’s harp-zither. He took the slender girl by the hand and led her to the kitchens, her walking staff tapping the ground before her with each step. The door shut behind them, cutting off their talk of which soup she might’ve liked.

“I’m leaving,” said Caide.

“But you just got here?”

“No, Dan.” Caide looked him in the eye. “I’m leaving.”

Dan sighed, put down his brush, and took off his spectacles. He’d been looking weary these days. There were dark circles under his eyes, and he lost his youthful sheen. Or maybe that was just sweat. “And where are you off to, if I might ask?”

“I’ll be staying at Hal’s for a while.”

“You call that leaving?” Dan said. “That’s just three streets over. A bit dramatic, wouldn’t you say? “

Caide said nothing as Dan studied his face with narrowed eyes.

Dan raised an eyebrow and thought for a moment. “What’s this really about, hmm?”

“I’m having the surgery,” Caide said.

“Will you, now?” Dan rubbed his temple. “I suppose that’s great news.”

Caide gritted his teeth, jaw clenched, lips shut tight in a hard line. He’d never been a great talker like Dan, but his words were failing him especially worse today. So he just sat there, kept his gaze down, and breathed in the ugly silence. 

“So it was you, then?” Dan asked in a flat tone. “You leaked the ledger.”

Caide nodded. No use denying it now. Where else would he have gotten the money?

Dan’s face was a cold mask, devoid of his usual bright-eyed, eager wit. He drummed his fingers on the table, mouth twisted in thought. “Out of the love I have for you, I’m giving you a chance to explain.”

Caide cleared his throat. “A week ago,” he said. “Miero handed me a note. Some hooded man told him to pass it on to me, apparently. He wanted to meet. Knew things about you. About me.” He let out a long breath. “He fucking used the kid, Dan. I know a threat when I see one.”

Dan nodded and motioned for him to continue.

“This bastard wanted something from your study,” Caide said. “Some list. He told me to look for names. Men you’ve bribed, he said. Simple enough. Light work, even. That very same night, I did it.” He sighed, shaking his head. “I didn’t even hesitate...”

“But the ledger’s still there, in my study–I checked.”

“He just made copies,” Caide said, shrugging. “Had some scribes with him. Before the sun was up, I’ve put it back where I found it. Quick, clean, and without incident.”

“Until the Cardinal found out, that is,” Dan said. He had a thoughtful look on him, the kind he had when he was planning something. “But you told me the how of it. I’m asking you why.”

“I didn’t see any other way,” Caide said quietly.

“Oh, didn’t you?” Dan sneered. “Nothing? Really? Wracked your brains, did you? You fucking idiot.” He dug a thumb to his chest. “You could’ve told me!” 

Told... him?

Now that Caide thought about it, why didn’t he tell Dan? It all sounded so simple. When he’d gotten word of the deal, he should’ve come clean–Dan would’ve known what to do. There was hardly a reason to go at it alone.

A tingling cold rushed from his fingertips all the way up his arm. It spread to his chest, climbed up his neck, wrapped around his face and ears, and settled in the roots of his hair. It was the icy realization that he, indeed, was a fucking idiot.

“I didn’t think–”

“Well, obviously you didn’t,” Dan said, his face softening a bit. “I refuse to believe there was any thinking being done at that time.” He drummed his fingers on the table, lips pursed in thought. “So,” he said after some time. “How much?”

“How much what?”

“How much did you sell me out for, you dumb bastard?”

“Right,” Caide winced. “We agreed on three thousand marks. I just wanted enough for the arm.”

“Huh,” Dan said. “That’s not half bad. He didn’t even negotiate?” 

“He didn’t, no... Why? You think I could’ve gotten more?”

Dan threw his head back and cackled like a goose. “You really are an idiot,” he said.

Caide had never been so relieved to see someone laugh, but it still didn’t sit right with him. He was a bastard who traded a friend for an arm. There would be no changing that. 

“Relax,” Dan said. “I see why you did it. Doesn’t make you less of a fool for doing so, but I get it.”

Caide wanted to spit it out. I’m sorry. Should be easy enough, yet a lump in his throat choked him into silence. He let the moment stretch out and pass them by. Coward. 

  

“How long would it take,” Dan said, “this surgery of yours?”

  

“A week, more or less,” Caide said. “The last thing we need should arrive from Silan in the morning. But I’ll need time to recover, and the arm will take getting used to.” 

  

“Alright,” Dan nodded. “I’ll see you in a week, then.” 

  

It took Caide a moment to understand. “You... want me back?” he asked, voice cracking in disbelief. 

  

“Of course,” Dan said. “How else will you help me climb out this shithole you put me in?” He narrowed his eyes at him. “You are coming back, aren’t you? Or are you planning on riding off into the sunset?” 

  

“Why?” Caide blurted out. “Because of me, you’re–” 

  

Dan raised a hand and cut him off. “How many times must I say it? I’m on your side, Caide. Always.” He had that annoyed look on him, one he had when explaining something obvious. “I’ve known you for what? Six, seven years now? All this time you didn’t make so much as a hint of trouble. Not a peep. One blunder every seven years?” He shrugged. “I can live with that.” 

  

“Is it really that easy? That simple?” 

  

“Yes, you fool. I hate to say it, but I lost everything already. I’m not losing a friend as well.”

  

Caide had been dreading this for weeks. The thought of leaving the simple, comfortable life he’d made for himself... He didn’t have the will to start over again. Not anymore. But he could stay–Dan said he wanted him back. A sliver of good fortune so rare that he started to question its existence. Still, it was more than he deserved.

“You’re holding this over my head forever, aren’t you?”

“Oh without a doubt,” Dan said, grinning.

Caide laughed for the first time in what felt like an age. “Wouldn’t have it any other way,” he said, grinning back.

Ever since the arm, Caide had just been wallowing on the things that went wrong for him. Years spent in self-pity. Dan had proven him wrong, however. Some things did go right for him this time–particularly his choice in company.

“Dan,” he said.

“Hmm?”

“I’m sorry.”

Dan chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. “Took you long enough,” he said. “Saving that for the end, were you?”

  

“No, I...” Caide looked Dan in the eye. “It’s not worth much right now, but I give you my word. This will never happen again.”

  

Dan nodded. “It better not. Betray me again and I’m poisoning your tea.”

  

“Believe me,” Caide said. “If I do, I’m drinking that tea myself.”

  

#####

Caide breathed in the dewy morning breeze and coughed to a choking sputter. He caught more than a whiff of something sour, something rotten, overnight sweat, and murky water. Wasn’t quite as refreshing as he would’ve liked–it was the docks, after all. The sky was just beginning to lighten to that sleepy, presunrise gray, but the Port of Meroun was already bustling with life. Hungry, desperate life.

A double-row of armed guards formed a barrier that paralleled the shoreline along the main wharf. Their speartips glinted in the torchlight. On one side of the barrier was the reason for it: a throng of sleepless, malnourished, and–by the way they grumbled and hollered–dissatisfied citizens of Lower Meroun. The city of everything–except food, as it turned out.

Most of the merchants on their side of the barrier were asleep or lounging on stools they brought, counting down the minutes. Just another night at the docks waiting for trading ships to arrive.

“Shouldn’t it be here by now?” asked Caide. “It’s almost first light.”

Toku shrugged. “It happens,” he said. Must’ve been nice to feel the cool wind in that vest and short trousers. “The captain of The Hundred Moons’ likely passed out in a brothel again. You’d think his first mate would be better at waking him up by now.”

Caide backhanded beads of sweat from his forehead. “Probably passed out beside him,” he said.

One of their porters stifled a yawn. A wiry youth with the same sun-tanned skin as Toku. Matta’s men, which were lent to him at Dan’s request. Two porters and a rickshaw at his service.

“Dan extends his thanks,” Caide said. “For the porters, and the accommodation.” A place with Toku’s crew, and access to The Hundred Moons’ cargo, just like that. Seemed like Dan’s word still held some weight to it.

“But of course,” Toku said, winking. “Anything for our round friend. This wouldn’t even cover half of what I owe him. Even Matta jumped at the chance to return the favor.”

The sound of breaking glass pierced the morning air, shards glittering in the first rays of sunlight. A wine bottle, by the looks of it. The row of armed guards shoved back the pressing crowd.

“Stay back!” one of the guards yelled. The once straight line of soldiers was bowing in places, and small gaps had appeared in their ranks.

A nearby merchant was startled from his stupor. “The ship here?” he asked dumbly, jolting upright and squinting at the shore.

Someone from the crowd cursed. Another cursed back. A mention of someone’s mother. More shoving, more cursing. Soon enough, the crowd was rumbling like a drunkard’s gut. The armed guards stepped back and pointed their spears forward, their boots cracking on stone. Disciplined and coordinated, as far as paid guards went. Must’ve been paid well.

“Fuck,” hissed Toku. “Say, Caide...”

“Hmm?”

“What’s in this crate you wanted so bad?”

“Something important,” Caide said. “Why?”

“Worth your life?”

Almost, Caide thought, considering what he’d given up for it.

“No?” said Toku, clutching the dagger at his hip. He jerked his head at the riling crowd. “You think it’s worth theirs?”

Caide had been on both sides of a brawl before. He’d stomped on some drunks, he’d gotten his face bashed in. But a full-on riot was an entirely different beast. A shambling mass of flesh and limbs, indiscriminate in its fury. It wasn’t something one fought; it was something one ran away from.

It would only need a small mistake. An insult hitting a vein. A thrown rock finding its mark. Someone getting stabbed, regardless of intent. This whole port would descend into madness, and for what? A chance at something to eat? Little did they know, everything on that ship had already been bought. These merchants were headed straight for the Inner district, not giving a shit about the starving people they passed over. They called it Lower Meroun for a reason, and it wasn’t because of where it stood.

“There it is!” someone shouted. A few in the crowd started pointing off into the horizon. “The Hundred Moons!” The shoving and hollering died down, most of them craning their necks and rushing to the shoreline to get a better look.

Off to the east, The Hundred Moons started to round the bend of the shimmering Crescent river, the rising sun at its back. Caide squinted at the glare, barely making out the ship’s thumbnail silhouette. It glided across the water at a leisurely pace, blissfully unaware of the chaos that waited at port. You’d think they would’ve hurried a bit, but you never really knew with these sailors.

“Finally,” sighed Toku. But he didn’t let go of his dagger just yet.

The guards had straightened their line again, and were pressing the crowd back. The crowd had quieted, watching eagerly for the coming ship. If anything, they looked relieved. Seemed like the worst of it was over.

The Hundred Moons was one of the many merchant ships that frequented the Port of Meroun. It stood out because of its size. An imposing vessel with bright red sails on its three towering masts, and bright green paint accenting its varnished-wood hull.

“What the fuck?” whispered Caide.

The ship closing the distance, however, looked nothing of the sort. For one thing, it was on fire. The hull was blackened and crumbling, paint peeling, turning gray from ash. Only one of the masts still stood; the other two reduced to smoldering stumps. The deck was a massive pyre, eating away at the sail and the web of ropes tied to the lonely mast, sending clouds of billowing black smoke to the heavens. There was no sign of the crew. No plea for help, no flags waved, no men jumping overboard.

The crowd, as well as the merchants across, shared a wave of groaning, shouting and screaming. Caide thought he heard some wailing in there as well. Might’ve done him some good to join in himself. He stood there mouth agape. A knot in his gut as cold and crushing as the river floor turned his blood to ice. The better part of three thousand marks–all up in flames. This can’t possibly be real, he thought. He scoffed, slapped his forehead, and choked down a laugh. A sick and twisted farce, surely. Some bastard god’s idea of a joke.

The remaining mast cracked in half from the flames and fell overboard. A small explosion erupted in the middle of the ship, spraying planks and splinters of wood, leaving a gaping hole in its hull. The Hundred Moons started sinking half an hour’s distance from port.

“Let’s head back,” said Caide. “There’s nothing for us here.”

Toku nodded and went off to gather his dumbstruck porters.

The crowd went into an uproar again. Started throwing things. Rocks and bottles and something he hoped wasn’t shit. Suddenly the row of armed guards looked flimsy–a frail attempt at containment. Like a stick trying to dam a stream. 

As they left, Caide looked back at the ship one last time. It was almost completely sunk, only the tip of its ashen bow jutting up from the water. Soon enough its wreck would rest at the bottom of the Crescent. Right next to his hopes of becoming whole again.
