Dan struggled up the incline like a man dragging his own corpse behind him. Each step was a Herculean feat, each breath a stolen luxury. Why anyone in their right mind would want to live on a hill was beyond him, a question that hovered unanswered above his weary head. But the old man wanted it, and Dan was in the business of making stubborn old men’s whims a reality.

Caide followed him, his steps as silent as a creeping fog. He clutched a basket of peaches as though it were the last thing standing between him and death by dehydration. He probably was sweating under that cloak, but unlike Dan, he wasn’t wheezing like a broken bellows. There was something to be said for letting a one-armed man carry the burden. Dan knew his limits. He was barely keeping himself upright, let alone with a cart’s worth of peaches.

“So what are you saying?” Caide’s voice was a soft murmur in the oppressive heat.

Dan’s brilliant idea to engage in conversation now seemed like the worst decision since he’d decided to skip breakfast. The idea of a distraction had been appealing, a little mental getaway from the relentless slog. But the only thing it accomplished was to sap his already dwindling strength. His shoes crunched and slid over the uneven terrain, a treacherous path that snaked through the forest of red pines and trudged uphill as if mocking him. Sunlight, sporadic and feeble, flickered through the canopy like the last few coins in a beggar’s cup. The air was a symphony of cicada buzz and the occasional bird’s chirp, set to the rhythm of his gasping breaths.

“I’m saying,” Dan panted, “in a few months, maybe half a year, I might be able to scrape together the money you need.” He cast a sidelong glance at Caide, who looked as though he was mentally somewhere else, as if he had wandered into a distant memory and forgotten to come back. “So get that arm fixed and quit your brooding, alright?”

He hadn’t expected Caide to burst into joyous song or start weeping with gratitude. But this look of disappointment? That was a new one. It was like he’d given him a lump of coal instead of gold.

“You think the Cardinal will go along with this plan?” Caide’s voice was laden with skepticism, the kind of doubt that could curdle milk.

Dan exhaled heavily, his breath coming in ragged bursts. “I think so. I hope so. We’ll see… if I don’t collapse from exhaustion before we reach the top.” The damned cart had broken an axle halfway up, as if the universe itself was conspiring to make his life a living hell.

“Alright…” Caide’s nod was more of a resigned acceptance than anything else. “Thanks.”

“That’s it?” Dan raised an eyebrow, his voice dripping with incredulity. “Just the other day you were a mess of tears and snot. What’s got you now, silent as a tomb?”

“It’s nothing,” Caide muttered, forcing a grin that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “I’m grateful. Truly. Must be the heat, I suppose?”

If the heat was the problem, then Caide’s insistence on wearing that wretched cloak must have been a form of self-punishment. The thing was black once, but now it was more of a sad gray, frayed and riddled with holes like an old rag. Dan had asked him before. Why the cloak? Caide had shrugged it off with some nonsense about not wanting people to see his weakness. It wasn’t the whole truth, but Dan had left it alone. Everyone had their secrets. There was something almost admirable in his stubborn refusal to let the world see him as anything less than what he wanted to be.

Caide caught Dan’s eye and sighed, guessing at the direction of his thoughts. “Don’t start on the cloak.”

“Well,” Dan said, “if you’re going to insist on wearing it, at least get a new one. In our line of work, appearances matter. No one’s going to take me seriously if my guard looks like a beggar.”

He hadn’t meant to be cruel, but with the cloak’s tattered state, Caide’s unkempt hair, and the scruffy stubble—someone had to point it out.

“No one’s taking you seriously if I took it off, either,” Caide retorted, scowling down at his cloak as if it had personally betrayed him. “But I get your point.”

Dan was about to collapse into a heap in a nearby clearing when he spotted it—a sliver of light at the end of the road. With the last of his strength, he staggered toward the gap in the trees, gasping like a fish thrown onto dry land. They emerged from the forest’s gloom and onto the southern face of Canopy Hill, the Cardinal’s villa finally in sight. Arrived at last, and thank the gods for it.

They were greeted by towering stone walls that loomed like ancient sentinels. Inside, a collection of imposing structures rose with an air of self-satisfied grandeur, all high terraces and tiered roofs that seemed to defy the heavens themselves. The Cardinal’s villa wasn’t in the same league as the King’s Summer Palace, but it wasn’t for lack of trying. Dan had made sure of that.

He approached the front gate beneath a stone archway large enough to accommodate two carts side by side. He hammered on the ornate bronze knocker, shaped like a stern bird with a ring clutched in its beak.

Dry throat and trembling knees, Dan’s patience was wearing thin as the heavy gates creaked open. A woman in her forties, clad in work robes and with a smooth, practiced smile, stepped out.

“Good morning,” she said, her voice as polished as the bronze knocker. “How may I assist you today?”

“Who are you?” Dan’s question slipped out, unfiltered. He blinked, realizing how rude it must have sounded. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to be blunt—just haven’t seen you before.”

“The Cardinal deemed it wise,” the handmaiden said, her tone clipped and efficient, “to make some staffing changes, sir.” She placed a hand on her chest and offered a small bow. “I am Mai. A pleasure to meet you.”

“Right,” Dan said, managing a tired nod. “We’re here to see the old man. I’m Dan, and—”

“The second-in-command hardly needs an introduction, sir,” Mai interrupted with a smile that barely hid her disdain. “I’m well aware of who you are. Please, come in.”

They followed her through the compound’s entrance and into the main doorway of the inner wall. Mai led them to a wooden bench in the sprawling stone garden, the pillars around them thick as tree trunks, casting their oppressive shadows. The villa’s architecture was a display of egotistical splendor, from the high terraces to the sloping tiled roofs. Too much for one man, but then, vanity was a Cardinal’s prerogative.

“I’ll inform the Cardinal of your arrival,” Mai said, “but he’s not quite ready for you yet. Please, wait here.”

“Is he well?” Dan asked, his gaze shifting to the basket of peaches he had brought. The old man had been looking a bit pale lately. Dan mentally noted to bring some ginseng next time.

“I’ll make sure he receives these,” Mai said, taking the basket with a nod. She retreated with a smooth, practiced step, disappearing into the central hall.

Dan and Caide exchanged a look.

Dan shrugged. “The old man’s age must be catching up to him,” he mused. He sank onto one of the wooden benches and began to rub his aching thigh. “They could have at least brought us some tea,” he grumbled.

Above the central hall’s doors hung a large white banner with the name ‘Redhallow’ scrawled in elegant, black brushstrokes. Pennant flags bearing the Cardinal’s red bird sigil fluttered in the breeze.

“He sure has a thing for birds, doesn’t he?” Caide observed. “Why not something a bit more intimidating? A tiger, perhaps?”

“We weren’t aiming for intimidation,” Dan said. “The old man wanted to reinvent himself, to mingle with nobility. I suggested a gentler image.”

“So that was you? You came up with the name ‘Redhallow’ too?”

“Yes,” Dan confirmed. “I was there when the organization started—a ragtag bunch of thieves and con men, and a certain young pickpocket. We’ve come a long way.” He inhaled the dewy morning air, tinged with incense and wisteria.

Caide squinted off toward the outer gate. “Be back in a bit,” he said, setting off toward the stables at a brisk trot.

Of course. Caide had a fascination with horses, or so it seemed. Dan never understood the allure of whispering to a horse’s mane, but if it kept Caide occupied, so be it. He couldn’t recall ever seeing Caide on horseback. Was it possible to ride with only one hand?

Dan had never seen the appeal. Thank the gods for carts, the true unsung heroes of travel. Whoever invented them deserved eternal gratitude. If only they could come up with sturdier axles…

Hardly a minute had passed when Caide’s tall figure reappeared, cloak flapping like a flag in the wind. He had that nose-flared, brow-furrowed look that spelled trouble.

“What’s wrong?” Dan asked as Caide approached.

“There are too many horses in there,” Caide said, his voice low and urgent.

“It’s a stable,” Dan pointed out, unamused.

“I’m serious,” Caide insisted. “Something’s off. I think—”

“Sir?”

Mai reappeared by the central hall’s entrance, her face a mask of professional indifference. “The Cardinal is ready for you now,” she said, her voice echoing across the courtyard. She stepped aside and motioned for Dan to enter.

“Not sure why,” Caide whispered, “but something smells fishy. I should go in with you.”

Dan dismissed his concern with a wave. If the Cardinal had any designs on harming him, there wasn’t much he could do about it. A fact he kept in the back of his mind, a grim reassurance.

“Well then,” Dan said, crossing the stone courtyard with grim determination. “Let’s find out. I’ll be back soon, hopefully with good news.” He glanced back to see Caide frowning, but sitting down anyway.

The scent of incense hit them as they entered the cavernous central hall. Mai launched into a detailed description of the villa’s features—the lion statues in the garden, the watercolor painting of mountains hanging before them.

“Please, Mai,” Dan interrupted with a weary smile. “You’re wasting your breath. I built this place myself.” He rubbed his chin, recalling. “Imported those statues from across the Jade Sea. Silan-made, pure alabaster. And that painting? Reng Woon, commissioned from him. The Lilyhopper, if you’ve heard of him.”

The Cardinal had once lamented the dusty city air suffocating him. A week later, Dan was in the middle of surveying plots of land and consulting with builders. The project had taken nearly two years, a mountain of gold, and a bottomless pit of patience. The old man had looked at the finished villa and declared it a miracle.

They reached the double doors of a room at the end of the hall. A lone sentry stood guard, Hidar, the Cardinal’s personal guard. A wiry monk in his forties, his once-bright orange garb now faded and threadbare. It seemed rags were the latest fashion in personal guards.

Hidar’s gaze was fixed on the floor, an immovable monument of silence. His vow of silence was as unnerving as it was unfathomable.

“The Cardinal is waiting for you,” Mai said.

“Hunched over his ledgers again, I assume?”

Hidar wordlessly slid open the doors, bowing low.

Dan nodded to Mai and stepped through, eager to escape Hidar’s eerie presence. The monk’s silence, the hollow eyes—something about it set Dan on edge. He could never quite shake the feeling.

The Cardinal’s meeting chamber was about as impressive as a beggar’s pelt, which was odd given the opulence of the rest of the damned estate. The room was a bleak expanse, practically empty except for a row of shelves lining the western wall. These shelves were crammed with ledgers and scrolls, meticulously arranged as if the Cardinal believed neatness could somehow mask the rot beneath.

Most of the space was occupied by a long table draped over with a rug so fine it looked like it could’ve been smuggled from a sultan’s bedchamber. Around it were scattered floor cushions, a wretchedly humble setting for a meeting of such import. Clearly, the Cardinal had no intentions of cluttering his sanctuary with unnecessary luxuries. Here, the message was clear: business, and little else.

Dan slunk in, searching for the old man, but it appeared he wasn’t alone. The Cardinal’s enforcers were there, four grim-faced men who looked like they’d been chewed up and spat out by the city’s nastier elements. They acknowledged Dan’s entrance with curt nods and raised cups, as if to say, “Oh, it’s you. How quaint.”

So, the mystery of the overstuffed stables had been unraveled. Now, what fresh nonsense was afoot, and why wasn’t he given the courtesy of an invitation? It didn’t sit right, and Dan had a nagging suspicion he was walking straight into a trap. Perhaps Caide’s paranoia wasn’t entirely misplaced after all.

The Cardinal reclined at the head of the table, lounging on a cushion like a disinterested cat. His silk robes, ostentatiously embroidered, hung loosely from his wiry frame. “Ah, Dan,” he said, drawing a deep puff from his pipe and exhaling a cloud of smoke thick enough to choke a man. “You grace us with your presence.”

Dan, ever the picture of composure, almost faltered. He didn’t have a clever retort ready; an unusual occurrence indeed. “I don’t--”

The Cardinal waved a hand dismissively, as though Dan’s excuses were of no more consequence than the crumbs on his floor. “I’m sure whatever caused your delay was of the utmost importance,” he said, his smile as insincere as a beggar’s plea. “There’s no need to dwell on it.”

Delay? He was unannounced, and now the old bastard was pretending it was a minor inconvenience? Something wasn’t adding up. Maybe they’d been scheming behind his back, cooking up a little surprise. Or perhaps the Cardinal had simply forgotten to send him the usual summons. Either way, the old man’s casual disregard was wearing thin.

Dan settled himself at the far end of the table, the place he’d earned by virtue of his rank. The Cardinal turned his gaze to his lackeys. “Anything else?”

Ah, so he wasn’t late. That was a relief, or at least it should have been. Dan took a perverse pleasure in watching these so-called enforcers squirm as they struggled to deliver their bad news, like a troupe of actors who’d flubbed their lines.

Kebre, a pudgy, balding relic of middle age, pulled at his tunic collar as if he could choke the incompetence from it. “Our next shipment of dust has been... further delayed, Your Excellency,” he croaked, eyes fixed firmly on the floor as if it might swallow him whole. “The docks are in chaos with these infernal summer fires... Half our warehouses are either burned or full to bursting.” He threw Dan a furtive glance, as if to imply it was his fault somehow.

Dan suppressed a smirk. It was, in a way. Just another piece in the grand mosaic of his plans.

The Cardinal’s brow furrowed, though his expression was more one of puzzlement than genuine concern. “Full, you say? Enlighten me, Dan. Surely, making room isn’t an insurmountable challenge. What could be more pressing than the nightdust?”

“Food,” Dan interjected, aiming for a tone of practiced modesty. He lowered his gaze and hunched his shoulders, a masterclass in false humility. “I’ve taken a gamble, Your Excellency. My informant at the House of Growth suggested this year’s crops would fall short of the city’s needs.”

The Cardinal’s interest piqued, his demeanor shifting from disinterest to intrigue. Dan reveled in the attention, savoring the moment as if it were the finest vintage.

“I’ve directed my managers to stockpile grain and secure additional imports,” Dan continued, laying it on thick. “I’m afraid this has necessitated some sacrifices in our storage. I hope you’ll understand.” He locked eyes with the Cardinal, letting a hint of satisfaction creep into his gaze. “Given the weak crop yield and the summer fires, there might come a time when only you can avert a citywide famine while turning a profit. I weighed it against some short-term gains and made a judgment call.”

He almost felt pity for the enforcers, who were now fidgeting like schoolboys caught cheating. But the Cardinal’s eyes glinted with approval. Of course. The plan benefitted him, after all. Dan might be a lowborn schemer, but he had a knack for making himself indispensable. If all went well, he’d be lauded as the city’s savior. The King and his ministers would have no choice but to acknowledge his brilliance.

The Cardinal raised his cup in a rare show of approval. “Excellent,” he said, his voice dripping with approval. “This is what I require: cunning and decisive action.” He took a sip, then looked around at the enforcers with a hint of mockery. “You see? This is how it’s done. Dan performs miracles.”

Dan’s plan was in motion, a masterstroke of calculation. Yet, as the Cardinal’s smile widened, Dan couldn’t shake the feeling that the old man was plotting something. He’d seen the glint in the Cardinal’s eye before, and it never meant anything good.

“Excellent,” the Cardinal said, his voice like honey drizzled over broken glass. “So, everything has been arranged?”

“Yes, Your Excellency,” Dan replied, his tone carefully neutral. “My managers are on it. If all goes according to plan, I won’t even have to get my hands dirty.”

“Wonderful. See to it that they halt their stockpiling operations and clear the warehouses for the nightdust. Even if it means selling the grain at a loss. Stagger the importation—twenty to thirty cartloads a week, sold immediately.”

Dan’s brow furrowed, and he struggled to keep the frustration out of his voice. “I don’t understand. These changes will undermine the entire objective. The city is on the brink of starvation. Surely that—”

“Which of my instructions are unclear?” The Cardinal’s smile had turned icy, a serpent coiled and ready to strike. “I appreciate your enthusiasm, Dan, but your plan betrays your ignorance.”

The enforcers around the table exchanged glances of muted glee, as if watching the intellectual peacock being stripped of his feathers. Dan’s stomach twisted with irritation, but he kept his face impassive. They were all fools, clinging to their petty fiefdoms. He alone understood the real stakes.

The Cardinal held up his glass, and Matta, the logistics man, moved to refill it with the speed of a well-trained servant. The old man gulped it down in one greedy swig. “You think depriving the city of nightdust is a good idea?” he said. “These people are addicts. Starvation is one thing, but the loss of nightdust is another matter entirely.”

The realization hit Dan like a punch to the gut. The old bastard was more concerned about his precious dust than the lives of the city’s people. If the summer fires hadn’t already driven Dan to the edge, this would have. If he had to choose between a starving city and keeping the dust addicts placated, the Cardinal had made his preference clear.

“I see,” Dan said through clenched teeth, bowing slightly. “As you wish, Your Excellency.” His mind was already racing, trying to come up with some way to salvage the situation. The Cardinal had a knack for making any reasonable argument seem like an affront to his personal honor.

“Good,” the Cardinal said, already looking past him. “And, Dan, I’ve been thinking.” The words hung in the air, heavy with impending doom. “I believe I’ve found a better use for your talents.”

Dan’s heart sank. Every time the Cardinal “thought” about something, it was usually an exercise in frustration and pain. “Another task?” he asked, though he already had a sinking feeling about what was coming.

“Yes,” the Cardinal said, a predatory gleam in his eye. “You’ll be turning over all your duties and properties to me. The ships, the trading company, the warehouses. Everything, except the tavern. Consider it a token of my... generosity.”

Dan felt the blood drain from his face. The Cardinal had just handed him a knife and twisted it with an expert’s touch. He was being discarded like yesterday’s trash, and for what? For having an inconvenient plan? For being late? The old man’s betrayal was as sudden as it was ruthless.

“How charming,” Dan said, forcing a smile as he clenched his fists to keep his rage in check. “And what, pray tell, is my new task?”

“Something appropriate for a man of your prodigious talents,” the Cardinal said, waving a dismissive hand. “You’re to deal with the summer fires. I’d hate to see everything I’ve built turn to ash. Perhaps the Summer God has taken an interest in my affairs.”

Dan stared at him, stunned. The fires were a city-wide issue, a seasonal calamity that no amount of bureaucratic maneuvering could fix. Building statues and sacrificing goats would do little to stop the flames. The idea of tackling the fires was absurd.

“I’ll... look into it, Your Excellency,” Dan said, barely keeping the sarcasm out of his voice.

The Cardinal nodded, dismissing him with a wave of his hand. “Good. If there’s nothing else...”

The other enforcers, seizing their opportunity, shuffled off with barely a backward glance. The door slammed shut behind them, and Dan was left alone with the Cardinal.

The old man leaned back, savoring the moment as if he were watching an insect squirm under a magnifying glass. Dan slumped onto the floor, feeling every bit the discarded pawn.

“So,” the Cardinal began, taking one last, contemplative drag from his pipe, “out of the love I’ve had for you, I’m giving you a chance to explain.”

“Explain?” Dan said, barely containing his anger. “Explain what? Why I’m being tossed aside like refuse?”

The Cardinal’s eyes narrowed, the smile slipping into something more sinister. “I made a new acquaintance recently. A young inspector from the Department of Lessons. His name is Sayin Abaya. He’s made some troubling claims.”

Dan’s heart raced. Sayin Abaya was trouble, a tenacious rat sniffing around where he didn’t belong. “And what does this rat have to do with me?”

The Cardinal reached into his robes and pulled out a folded sheet of paper. He flicked it across the table with an air of finality. “Does this look familiar?”

Dan unfolded the paper, his blood turning to ice. It was a page from his private ledger, detailing bribes and payments. The very page he’d kept under lock and key, protected by layers of deception and secrecy. How in the hell did this get out?

“It seems,” the Cardinal said, his voice dripping with condescension, “that there’s been some unfortunate leakage. The Head Lector’s inspector is... keenly interested.”

Dan’s mind raced, scrambling to find a way out of this mess. The evidence was damning, and the Cardinal’s insinuation was clear: his days of scheming and controlling the city were over.

“I can fix this,” Dan said, forcing calm into his voice. “Let me handle it.”

The Cardinal’s smile was as cold as winter’s breath. “No, Dan. There will be no more chances. I’ve been too generous, and now you’ve grown too bold.”

Dan felt the sting of betrayal cut deep. Twenty years of loyalty, and now he was being cast aside like a broken tool. If he had to go, he would take his chance to make a mark, to show the old man just what he’d thrown away.

“Then there’s nothing more to discuss,” Dan said, his voice low and resolute. He bowed deeply, feeling the weight of the old man’s disdain on his back. “By your leave, Your Excellency.”

As he turned for the door, Dan’s thoughts swirled with a storm of anger and betrayal. The Cardinal had underestimated him, and now he was more determined than ever to prove just how wrong the old man was. If he had to bring the whole damn house down to do it, he would.
