Chapter Goals:
- Introduce Dan (focus on characterization, hint at his Machiavellian tendencies)
- Set up the world he’s living in (Redhallow and the Cardinal, etc.)




[Dan is on the way to Canopy Hill. The axle of his cart broke, so he and Caide are walking the mountain path.]

[Dan arrives, and the celebration is underway. Describe the grandeur of the Cardinal’s new villa, maybe lightly introduce the characters from Redhallow and that whole society they navigate.]

[By the stables, Dan asks Caide what he thinks of a prominent noble’s security. Caide admits that he thinks it’s a bit excessive. A full compliment of guards just for a night out. Dan remarks to himself that it reveals how these nobles view them. They’ll take their money and attend their parties, but they’re still criminals in their eyes. He then asks Caide what’s the worst that could happen to them on the road back, and Caide explains in detail.]

“How about that. A whole damn army just for a night with us common folk. Sure, they’ll take our gold, swallow our wine and moon cakes, but at the end of the day we’re nothing but wretches to them. Something to keep at arm’s length.” Dan scoffed. “*Nobles.*”

Caide grunted. A disagreeing kind of grunt.

“What?”

“Nothing,” Caide said.  “Just a strange irony, is all. You spit at their wake, yet you do your damnedest to strut around in their finery and play their games. Look at this place. Isn’t this an attempt at living their lives?”

[More Canopy Hill description here. Maybe throw in some rationalizations by Dan.]

“Why should they have all the fun?” Dan said with a grin. Coming from anyone else, he would’ve taken his bluntness as disrespect. But honesty was a rare thing nowadays, and not without its merits. Thankfully, he could always count on Caide to slap him with a hard truth once in a while. “But still, a whole retinue of armed guards? Less understanding men than I might find that insulting.”

“Maybe it’s not about you,” Caide said. “Ever thought about that? He has his wife and child with him, and we’re ways away from the city walls. These mountain roads are dark and twisting. You ask me, he should’ve brought more men.”

“What do you mean? Like… bears? Or a tiger?” Dan knew full well what Caide meant, of course, but he liked to pretend at ignorance on occasion. Kept others from overestimating him. Besides, he considered any conversation with Caide that stretched more than a few words and grunts to be a small victory in itself. 

Caide stared off into the distance, beyond the walls of Canopy Hill, at the thicket of trees by the hillside. “Worse. Bandits.”

[Dan remarks to himself that they were just taking a stroll in this supposedly bandit-infested mountainside not a few hours ago.]

 “Come now. What chances do bandits have against professional guards? Surely they’d just–” Dan chopped at his palm. “Like swatting a fly, eh?”

Caide shrugged. “Anything can happen in a fight. More so a fight in the dark.”

“Humor me, would you? Say you’re one of these bandits. Their leader, perhaps. How would you do it? You see this nobleman pass by, all smiles and full bellies while you and your kin get by on scraps. How would you right this wrong? How would you fix this injustice in the world?”

“Are you asking me how I would ambush Minister Diwa’s convoy?” Caide narrowed his eyes at him. “Why would you even want to know? You better not be planning treason, Dan. And if you were, you best leave me out of it.”

“Treason?” Dan chuckled. “Honestly, there’s something to be said about how you always jump to the worst conclusions. You should look into that, you know? Reflect.”

Caide scoffed. “Is that right? Then what purpose could you possibly have for wanting to know? *How would you fix this injustice in the world?* Spare me the riddles, Dan. If you want something, just ask.”

“It’s purely hypothetical, if you must know. See, there’s something I need to discuss with our most honored guest. But here’s the problem–he doesn’t know me, does he? As far as he’s concerned, I’m just the Cardinal’s steward, maybe his head clerk. I know these nobles. He’s not likely to listen to me, let alone take me seriously.”

“And he’d take you seriously when you ambush him in the middle of the road? Quite the strategy you have there.”

“Would you just let me finish?” Dan scowled. “Like you said, he has his wife and child with him. I now realize that a man in his sixties isn’t likely to father another heir, so he’s being especially protective. Now if someone should happen to–for instance–warn him of potential dangers on the road, wouldn’t that be a likely opportunity to earn his favor?”

“Ah, so you plan to impress him with your worldly knowledge of banditry, is that it?”

“*Exactly.* That’s why I need details. Specifics. Now won’t you be a dear and just tell me already?”

Caide pursed his lips in thought, a halfhearted attempt at poking holes in his logic. Finally, he sighed and gave a nod. “Fine.”
