Since Gida was up to his ears in debt, he settled for merely gambling with his life. Wasn't much of a life, to be honest, but it was all he had to work with. 

He usually taught the lessons at the garden, and so there he waited. One of the stewards served his usual tea and a platter of assorted nuts and sunflower seeds. Some quality-looking lacquerware they had here. He thought about nicking one of the teacups on the way out, as he was nearing the end of his tenure anyway. Straight-backed and with all the grace and dignity he could muster, he sipped as much green tea as etiquette would allow. He didn't think he'd be so fond of the stuff. *Bitter leaf juice*, he once called it. Funny how threats to one's life opened up an appreciation for things otherwise ignored.

The sprawling grounds of [Clan] Estate stretched out before him. Brimming with exquisite fauna, the-- 

*Wait. 'Exquisite fauna?' Using rich-people words now, was he?*

The fragrant guava trees, summer-green grass, and delicate water lilies  impressed upon Gida the luxuries he didn't even dream of having. As if the Deputy Minister decided upon himself to live in a damned painting. Not to mention the house itself, with its traditional woodwork architecture, sweeping tiled roofs, and lion statues made of stone that loomed as sentries. He doubted that he could afford anything in this place, even the ornate chair pressed up on his ass. All that, when Deputy Minister [Clan] was supposed to be one of the poorer nobles in the city. One of the dumber ones too--which was exactly why he was the target.

"Master Gidarin," the steward said with a voice like a grindstone. "I apologize for the delay. Young Master [Boy] will join you shortly." 

Gida wasn't sure how a renowned Sage would respond to this tardiness. Should he take offense? He'd been keeping up the self-important façade flawlessly for almost a month now. The role came naturally to him, being a lifelong prick himself. He settled for a curt nod.

The steward took a bow and shuffled off. Gida narrowed his eyes--he failed to recognize this younger, gruff-looking steward. Perhaps the one he was familiar with took a day off. He would've asked, but a Sage wouldn't bother with the servants, he reckoned.

Defrauding the Deputy Minister wasn't something he'd willingly attempt. A foolhardy endeavor, but the debt collectors and their fixation with his limbs didn't leave him much of a choice.
