Chapter Goals:

- A 'Sequel' Chapter 
- Establish the Prison Break
- Show Dan making plans to fight the Summer Fires
- Show Caide's reaction from the sinking of *The Hundred Moons*


What *Couldn't* Happen:
- Grin shows up (too early)
-  Miero dies (not yet)

What Could Happen:
- Something related to the Cardinal
- Aftermath of the dock riot
- The Cardinal's men still looking to Dan for advice

Plot:

- Making allies (how to deal with a man's pride) "Dan kept his gaze down, hesitated, and added hitches and stutters as he spoke. A balancing act between humility and competence. A necessary chore as to not make it so obvious that knew better. But he always did, and he wearied from offending lesser men for it. He hinted at self-interest. Its absence rang alarm bells in tiny minds, unable to conceptualize a motive that differed from their own."
- How to manipulate the old man (Intonation, shoot down suggestions)
- Dan lets Seyla go
- Caide brings in a dossier of prison inmates
- Dan hints at the plan to do something
- "You've given it a good enough try, Caide. Shit happens. Nothing you could do about a sunken ship, man. Listen. Perhaps we could turn our efforts elsewhere? We're not giving up on your arm just yet, but right now this city needs saving. As much as it pains me, I must admit--I can't do it without you."
  
  "How can I help?"
  

Theme: "You want something done right, you have to do it yourself."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Dan might've rubbed his temple down to the bone with all the shit he had to deal with today. In fact, one of those problems stared him in the face. "How may I help you, Kebre?"

Kebre fidgeted across his desk, the bags under his eyes drooping down to his cheek. "His Excellency-- he's been making some... questionable decisions as of late..." "He refuses to heed any counsel at every turn. It's hasn't been the same when you left. Nothing gets done."

"And you're telling me this because?"

Kebre sighed. "Dan... Must you really do this? Can't the two of you make amends?"

"You were there. I tried reasoning with him. Twenty years... He didn't even blink when he stripped me of everything. Tragic, isn't it? But alas, life goes on."

"It was... a mistake on his part. He didn't know what he was losing. But I do. We all do. Please, Dan. Help us."

"Let's say I'm moved by your plight. Suppose that I've healed from the wound of having none of you stand up for me."

Kebre winced. "Ah. You know how--"

Dan cut him off with a raised finger. "Whatever could the disgraced, powerless me possibly do?"

"If the old man wont take you back..." Kebre hesitated, his eyes darting around the door, then the closed window. "Maybe he isn't fit to lead us anymore." He leaned in. "Maybe retirement would suit him better."

Dan raised his eyebrows. "Mutiny? Why, I didn't think you had it in you, Kebre." He chuckled. "Congratulations. It took the better part of five decades, but you finally grew a pair." 

"Don't fuck with me Dan. These are shit times we're living in, and I'm all out of damn ideas. You got anything better?" he jeered.

"Anything's better than what you're suggesting. You really think Hidar would betray the old man?"

"Wouldn't he?"

"Not a chance. I don't know what kind of understanding, or deal, or gods-damned *blood pact* they might've had, but he's the Cardinal's man to the end. I think we both know how unwise it is to make an enemy of him."

"He's just one man."

"Is he?"

"Bah. This again. Spare me the nonsense, will you?"

"You know I'm right about this. Yet you refuse to believe it."

"I'm going to need more than your word to believe such a thing."

"Alright, you want proof. Let's see... Remember the Blackdock boys? Pestered us for years, hoarding and reselling our dust. I've been asking the old man to let me deal with them, but he insisted we pay them no mind. Reckon they're not worth the trouble. Mighty generous of him if you ask me. 

"Yes... he called it charity. I remember. What's this have to do with Hidar?"

"Stay with me. One day we got wind that these Blackdock hand-fuckers started getting friendly with the Kanlori. Remember what happened next?"

"Let me guess... They all got on a boat to Kanloran and started a new life with their newfound friends?"

"Hmm, not quite. You see, when news broke that the Kanlori were sniffing around our docks, it didn't even take an hour for the old man to send for me. He was furious--like nothing I've ever seen. Mad, bulging eyes. Didn't even touch his drink the whole time we talked, if you can believe that. Not a drop. I managed to calm him down, of course, promising this and that--but I don't think it was a coincidence that I glimpsed something Hidar-shaped leaving Canopy Hill that night."

Kebre narrowed his eyes at him. "So? You think Hidar paid them a visit? Even so, that's one man against a crew of what? A dozen? Maybe more? Impossible."

"Not for a sage."

"You're mad."

"Am I? Think about it. It was around the first rains of typhoon season when they disappeared. We didn't notice at first, did we? They were flies, and we'd gotten used to their buzzing. I'm telling you--the timing fits."

"Maybe they made a deal? Who knows? What about threats? Those work too."

"I would've known. I... I had someone keeping an eye on them. A spy, of sorts. Haven't heard from him in months--it's like he just disappeared. That's what bothered me in the first place. "

"Maybe he-- Agh, fuck it. I don't believe you just yet, but let's say you're right. That seems like an overreaction on the Cardinal's part, don't you think? I've known him to be ruthless, but this..."

"I know... I didn't want to believe it either. You're the first to hear of this, and I don't plan on telling anyone else. You'd be wise to do the same."
