*everything stated below can not affect living beings, except the caster's self.

  

1. Judgement - improves or diminishes an object's specific property. The property must not be its appearance or physical form or its temperature. The Judgement only works if the change in the object is able to happen logically. Can also be used to alter other magics.
 - Ex: NOT a blade's sharpness, since it depends on the physical aspect of how thin the edge is. 
 - Improving or diminishing a stone's 'brittleness', making it easier or harder to break. 
 - Increasing or decreasing the pull of the earth on a specific patch of ground, making objects in it heavier or lighter.
 - The 'motion' of a freely moving object like an arrow or a falling tree, to slow it down or speed it up, or remove its motion entirely.

2. Warmth - alters an object's temperature. 
- Ex: Hot metal. 
- If used with 'Light', will produce fire.
- Removal of heat resulting in cold.

  
3. Light - Creates/alters light
- Ex: Blocking the light from an area. Specifically, a person's eyes, making them blind.
- If used with 'Break' and 'Destiny' will create a targeted lightning strike.
- If used with 'Endure', creates a static after-image.

4. Break - destroys things. Cannot be used with 'Endure'.
- Ex: summons cracks or fissures in stone, metal, wood, etc.
- shattering completely
- if used with 'Light' and 'Heat', causes explosions.

5. Endure - preserves the current state of things.
- Ex: negate attacks by not allowing armor to break

6. Destiny - dictates the direction of an object.
- Ex: advanced users can use it for telekinesis.
- arrows always hit its mark.

1. Time - gives the user an influence over how time affects him. Cannot reverse time. Not usually used as it is difficult to predict and is very costly.
- Ex: User flows through time faster, making his experience of time go slower, like an adrenaline rush.
- When used with 'Endure' and 'Destiny', can be used to teleport.
