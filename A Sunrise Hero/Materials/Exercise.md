Dan reached into his satchel, pulled out a taffy, unwrapped it, and popped it in his mouth. He just started sucking on the taffy when he feigned being startled. "Oh, right," he said. "You want one?" He pulled out another taffy and offered it to Sol Iraga.

Sol looked at the taffy and considered it, face impassive. 

*Go on. Take it,* Dan thought. Personally, he wasn't much for sweets, but one of his spies at the Iraga household told him that Sol had a fondness for it. Something he shared with his mother, or so he heard.  A small connection. Something in common. That was all he needed. Maybe the next time he'd be having one of these taffies, he'd think of him, and look to him with more favor the next time they meet.

"No, thank you," Sol said. "Shouldn't you be worried about your friend there?"

He probably should, but Caide had that look on him now. A kind of fiery life in his eyes. Like he couldn't possibly lose. He'd seen that before. Once. Now he didn't know much about fighting, but the fact that he was still alive against a man like that, he thought, was a promising sign. "Shouldn't you be worried about your father?"

"I am," Sol said, with a well-hidden sorrow. "Always. But more so, sir, with what he'd do next."

*Sir,* *he said.* Like they were equals. Like he wasn't three lifetimes beneath his station. Like there was something worth respecting about him. He wanted to believe that. In fact, he almost did.
