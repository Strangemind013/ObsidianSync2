Dr. Benita Sta. Ana-Ponio


Possible Prologue with Caide as a Disavowed.

  
Once there was a man named Caide. He was a cripple, and well aware of the fact. He was one of those men that appeared to suffer nothing, just going along with whatever life throws at him. He held that same mask of disinterest as he spent his days as Dan’s guard. 

  

Caide’s job as a guard required him to do nothing, since Dan was a man that had no quarrel with anyone, and made no enemies for himself. Dan was skilled in business, and a shrewd negotiator. He has a sense for the desires of whomever he meets, and so uses it to get what he wants. Early on, he had taken the notice of the Cardinal, the local crime lord, and had taken him under his wing. Years passed, and Dan had made a name for himself. The Collector, they called him. One of the Cardinal's lieutenants, tasked with managing their organization's legitimate businesses and finances.

  

At one point, Caide finds out about the existence of an Artifactian, a Sage that can fabricate magical prostheses. It was an old lady with an adopted son. Dan kept the info from him because he himself is using a prosthetic, but it causes him immense pain just to be able to walk. This secret causes friction between them later on. 

  

The previously aloof and unmotivated Caide has now found a purpose. He put all his effort into getting the money for the procedure. He got into a deal with someone from the King’s secret service, asking him to spy on the Cardinal. 

  

At that point in time, multiple fires had been devastating the city. More than the usual summer fires. The Cardinal, in a response to Dan’s recent success, has given him a seemingly impossible task: to put a stop to the worsening summer fires. “It appears you’re proficient with the impossible… I must rely on you once again.”

  

Now Dan has three problems before him. One, he needed men. Two, he needed a place to house those men. Three, he needed money. That, he and Caide now had in common.

  

As Dan was mulling over what to do next, he realizes that his worries might have shown in his face since Caide, who never gets involved, has now been asking questions left and right. “Aren’t you supposed to be rich?” Dan explains that while he might seem wealthy, most of his wealth isn’t in gold right now. Especially since he’s just done buying land on the outskirts of the city. He needed someone to finance this whole operation. Caide hesitantly admits that he might know someone that could help. 

  

Caide comes out with the fact that he has been leaking information about the Cardinal. He tells him of his spywork for the King’s secret service. Dan was pretty chill about it, and asked Caide to set up a meeting with this spymaster. 

  
  

At one point, Caide will have to ask the minister of Steel for help with Grin. He challenges him to a fight, which ends in a draw. He sends his son to help.

  

The climax of the story would be Caide choosing to remove his newly attached prosthetic to be able to fight Grin. He uses an attack formation that he and the Smokesons practiced.

  

The story ends with a pyrrhic victory over the Avrahir. The city is in ashes. Grin effortlessly escapes in pursuit of the newly revived Scion, who had flown off somewhere to the west. In the Scion’s tomb, Dan and the Smokesons find an abundance of a strange new mineral they have yet to identify.


On book 2 (If it even comes to existence,) Caide supposedly sacrifices his life for their leader by killing him and have the leader’s soul take over his body. Instead the leader dies for good, and Caide finds out that he can kill “Soul-hoppers” definitively.
